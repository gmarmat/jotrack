# Documentation Audit Report - October 21, 2025

**Auditor**: AI Assistant  
**Files Audited**: AGENT_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md, .cursorrules  
**Trigger**: User request to check for conflicts  
**Status**: ✅ CONFLICTS RESOLVED

---

## 🔍 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Confusing Current vs Planned State

**Problem**:
- Guide said "8 layers" but Layer 8 (headhunter) not yet implemented
- User journey showed headhunter steps as if already working
- Algorithm score showed "100/100" (future state, not current)

**Confusion Risk**: 
> AI or developer reads guide, thinks headhunter is implemented, tries to use it, fails.

**Fix Applied**:
✅ All headhunter references now marked "PLANNED"
✅ Algorithm score: "97/100 (current) → 100/100 (with planned support)"
✅ Layer 8: "PLANNED - Not yet implemented!"
✅ User journey: "PLANNED:" prefix on headhunter steps
✅ Quality metrics: Clear current vs planned split

---

### Issue 2: .cursorrules Not Enforced

**Problem**:
- Rule says "ALWAYS read AGENT_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md BEFORE making changes"
- AI violated this when planning headhunter feature
- Started planning without reading guide first
- Resulted in wrong initial plan (adding to jobs table vs people_profiles)

**Confusion Risk**:
> Rule exists but isn't strong enough to prevent violations.

**Fix Applied**:
✅ Upgraded header: "🚨 MANDATORY FIRST STEP 🚨"
✅ Added explicit workflow: READ → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → UPDATE
✅ Added concrete example: "BEFORE planning headhunter..."
✅ Clarified when rule applies (planning, analyzing, coding, not just implementing)
✅ Added verification step (does plan align with guide?)

---

### Issue 3: "Two Systems" Language

**Problem**:
- Guide said "two systems" (Match Matrix and Interview Coach)
- Actually: ONE system (JoTrack) with TWO features
- Could confuse developers into thinking they're separate codebases

**Confusion Risk**:
> Developer thinks Match Matrix and Interview Coach are independent systems.

**Fix Applied**:
✅ Replaced "two systems" with "ONE system, TWO features"
✅ Added clear architecture diagram showing connection
✅ Explained data flow between features
✅ Emphasized "working together seamlessly"

---

## ✅ Current State (After Fixes)

### AGENT_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md Structure

**Section 1: Project Overview** (Lines 1-57)
- ✅ Clear: ONE system, TWO features
- ✅ Current Phase: V2.7
- ✅ User journey: 18 steps (with "PLANNED" markers)

**Section 2: Complete Architecture** (Lines 59-182)
- ✅ User journey broken into 3 phases
- ✅ Data storage explained (all tables)
- ✅ Data flow between features
- ✅ Clear what's current vs planned

**Section 3-9**: [Existing sections - unchanged]

**Section 10: How JoTrack Uses Data** (Lines 778-862)
- ✅ Clear distinction: Signals (Match Matrix) vs Layers (Interview Coach)
- ✅ Explains connection (signals aggregate → Layer 1)
- ✅ Separate purposes, different data types

**Section 11: Interview Coach Algorithm** (Lines 866-1064)
- ✅ Current status: 97/100 (7 layers)
- ✅ Planned: 100/100 (8 layers with headhunter)
- ✅ All 8 layers documented (Layer 8 marked PLANNED)
- ✅ Layer flow explained (which phases use which layers)

## 📊 Conflict Resolution Matrix

| Item | Before | After | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Algorithm Score** | "100/100" (misleading) | "97/100 (current) → 100/100 (planned)" | ✅ Fixed |
| **Input Layers** | "8 layers" (misleading) | "7 current, 8 planned" | ✅ Fixed |
| **Layer 8** | Listed without status | "PLANNED - Not yet implemented" | ✅ Fixed |
| **User Journey** | Headhunter steps (ambiguous) | "PLANNED:" prefix | ✅ Fixed |
| **People Tables** | recruiter_type listed (ambiguous) | "PLANNED:" prefix | ✅ Fixed |
| **System Language** | "two systems" (confusing) | "ONE system, TWO features" | ✅ Fixed |
| **.cursorrules** | "ALWAYS read" (weak) | "🚨 MANDATORY FIRST STEP 🚨" | ✅ Fixed |

**Total Conflicts**: 7  
**Conflicts Resolved**: 7  
**Success Rate**: 100% ✅

## 🎯 Audit Checklist (For Future Updates)

### Before Committing Documentation Changes

- [ ] Verify current vs future state is clear
- [ ] Check all "NEW!" markers are accurate
- [ ] Ensure planned features marked "PLANNED"
- [ ] Verify numbers match (7 vs 8 layers, 97 vs 100 score)
- [ ] Confirm no conflicting information
- [ ] Test: Would a new developer understand what's implemented vs planned?

### After Implementing a Planned Feature

- [ ] Find all "PLANNED" markers for that feature
- [ ] Update to "IMPLEMENTED" or remove marker
- [ ] Update current state numbers (7→8 layers, 97→100 score)
- [ ] Update user journey (remove "PLANNED:" prefix)
- [ ] Add to "Current State" section
- [ ] Document actual implementation (not just design)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. AI didn't read guide before planning headhunter
2. Initial plan violated architecture (wrong table)
3. Documentation mixed current and future state
4. .cursorrules existed but wasn't strong enough

### What We Fixed
1. ✅ Strengthened .cursorrules (MANDATORY language)
2. ✅ Clarified current vs planned (clear markers)
3. ✅ Fixed all conflicting numbers (7 vs 8, 97 vs 100)
4. ✅ Added workflow (READ → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → UPDATE)

### Process Improvement
**Old Process**:
```
User asks → AI plans → AI codes → AI docs
(Reading guide was optional)
```

**New Process**:
```
User asks → AI READS GUIDE FIRST → AI plans (aligned) → AI codes → AI UPDATES GUIDE
(Reading guide is MANDATORY)
```

## ✅ Current State Verification

### What's IMPLEMENTED (Current):
- ✅ Match Matrix (60 signals)
- ✅ Interview Coach (7 layers)
- ✅ Algorithm score: 97/100
- ✅ People profiles (basic)
- ✅ Company intelligence
- ✅ Data Pipeline (PDF extraction working!)

### What's PLANNED (Not Yet Implemented):
- ⏳ Layer 8: Headhunter Context
- ⏳ recruiter_type field
- ⏳ search_firm_name field
- ⏳ Specialty match calculation
- ⏳ Dual-lens question distribution
- ⏳ Algorithm score: 100/100

**No Confusion**: Guide clearly separates current from planned ✅

## 🚀 Going Forward

### For AI Assistants

**EVERY time you start working**:
1. ✅ Read AGENT_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md FIRST (relevant sections)
2. ✅ Understand current state (what's implemented)
3. ✅ Check for existing patterns
4. ✅ Plan aligned with architecture
5. ✅ Implement following standards
6. ✅ Update guide after implementation

**NEVER**:
- ❌ Skip reading guide ("I'll just figure it out")
- ❌ Mix current and planned state in docs
- ❌ Document features as if implemented when they're not
- ❌ Violate .cursorrules

### For Developers

**Before working on any feature**:
1. Read AGENT_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md (complete system architecture)
2. Read .cursorrules (mandatory workflow)
3. Search codebase for similar patterns
4. Plan changes aligned with guide
5. Implement with tests
6. Update guide to reflect changes
