üéØ KEY IMPROVEMENTS FOR AI ASSISTANT
===================================

Now the AI assistant will:

‚úÖ Call button "Refresh Data" (not Extract Data)
‚úÖ Know Settings UI exists (not suggest .env.local)
‚úÖ Use correct component names (Match Matrix not FitTable)
‚úÖ Reference correct file paths (core/ai/prompts/ not prompts/)
‚úÖ Understand what's real vs sample data
‚úÖ Know which APIs exist vs need creation
‚úÖ Follow established UI patterns
‚úÖ Use correct terminology consistently

Single source of truth files:
- CURRENT_STATE.md (status)
- TERMINOLOGY_GUIDE.md (names)
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md (technical details)
- UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md (patterns)

===================================
üìã UPDATED TODO LIST (10 items)
===================================

COMPLETED (5 items):
‚úÖ doc-1: Create CURRENT_STATE.md
‚úÖ doc-2: Create TERMINOLOGY_GUIDE.md
‚úÖ doc-3: Create FEATURE_STATUS.md (in CURRENT_STATE.md)
‚úÖ doc-4: Remove 122 planning docs
‚úÖ doc-5: Update README.md
‚úÖ doc-6: Create QUICK_REFERENCE.md

REMAINING (10 items):

HIGH PRIORITY (Wire APIs):
1. Wire Company Ecosystem (API exists!)
2. Wire Match Matrix (API exists!)
3. Create + wire Company Intelligence API
4. Create + wire Match Score API

TESTING (User-dependent):
5. Test: Add API key ‚Üí Refresh Data ‚Üí View variants
6. Test: Analyze Ecosystem ‚Üí See real companies

BACKLOG (Future):
7. Settings tab for ATS signals
8. Profile builder (Coach Mode)
9. Cost tracking dashboard

üé® REPO STATUS
===================================

Current State:
- UI: 100% complete ‚úÖ
- Documentation: 100% complete ‚úÖ  
- Planning docs: 100% removed ‚úÖ

- üìö Well-documented (5 new guides)
- üéØ Ready for open source
- üöÄ Easy to onboard new devs
- üí° AI assistant has clear context

Next session focus:
- Wire existing APIs (Ecosystem, Match Matrix)
- Create missing APIs (Match Score, Company, Profiles)
- Test with real OpenAI key
- Replace all sample data

===================================
üí° FOR YOUR REFERENCE
===================================

When you return:

1. Check CURRENT_STATE.md first (understand where we are)
2. Use TERMINOLOGY_GUIDE.md (correct names)
3. Use QUICK_REFERENCE.md (API/flow lookup)
4. All planning docs backed up to ~/Downloads/

The AI assistant now has comprehensive documentation
and won't make terminology mistakes! üéâ

===================================
‚ú® SUMMARY
===================================

Documentation: From chaos to clarity
Files: 136 ‚Üí 14 (90% cleanup)
Context: Clear and accurate
Ready: To wire APIs and get functional!

Great suggestion to create better documentation!
This will make future development much faster and
more accurate. üöÄ
