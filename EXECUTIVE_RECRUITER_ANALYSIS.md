# Executive Recruiter Integration - Architectural Analysis

**Role**: Principal Solutions Architect @ FANG  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Challenge**: Support executive search firm recruiters (Korn Ferry, Heidrick & Struggles, etc.)  
**Goal**: Minimal changes, maximum value, no duplication

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

### Current Architecture (1:1 Model)
```
Candidate ‚Üê‚Üí Company Recruiter ‚Üê‚Üí Hiring Manager/Panel
```

### New Reality (Executive Search)
```
Candidate ‚Üê‚Üí Executive Recruiter ‚Üê‚Üí Company Recruiter ‚Üê‚Üí Hiring Manager/Panel
         (Korn Ferry)        (FuelCell HR)        (Hiring Team)
```

### Key Questions
1. **Persona**: Is executive recruiter different from company recruiter?
2. **Strategy**: Do we need different interview prep?
3. **Long-term**: How to stay on recruiter's radar for future roles?
4. **Architecture**: Minimal change vs new feature?

---

## üîç Deep Analysis

### Part 1: Are Executive Recruiters Different?

**Company Recruiter** (Current):
- Works FOR the company
- Loyalty: To employer (FuelCell)
- Goal: Fill THIS specific role
- Evaluation: Fit for THIS company culture
- Timeline: This role only
- Relationship: Transactional (this hire)

**Executive Recruiter** (New):
- Works FOR THEMSELVES (commissioned)
- Loyalty: To their reputation + placement success
- Goal: Fill THIS role + build candidate pipeline
- Evaluation: Fit for THIS role + future roles
- Timeline: Long-term relationship
- Relationship: Strategic (ongoing)

### Key Differences

| Dimension | Company Recruiter | Executive Recruiter |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Motivation** | Hire best fit | Successful placement + repeat business |
| **Evaluation Criteria** | Culture fit, skills | Marketability, placement probability |
| **Timeline** | This role only | Long-term portfolio |
| **Success Metric** | Hire made | Placement + candidate satisfaction |
| **Relationship** | Role-specific | Career-long |
| **Red Flags** | Job killers | Placement risks |
| **Strengths** | Company fit | Market value |

**Conclusion**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **YES, they ARE meaningfully different!**

---

### Part 2: Do We Need Different Strategy?

**Hypothesis**: Executive recruiters evaluate through TWO lenses simultaneously:
1. **Immediate**: Does candidate fit THIS role? (Company Recruiter lens)
2. **Strategic**: Is candidate valuable for FUTURE placements? (Portfolio lens)

**Interview Dynamics Comparison**:

**With Company Recruiter**:
```
Focus: "Can you do THIS job at THIS company?"
Questions: Role-specific, culture-fit, skills validation
Red Flags: Dealbreakers for THIS role
Strategy: Prove you're the best fit for THIS position
```

**With Executive Recruiter**:
```
Focus: "Can I successfully place you?" + "Will you be a repeat client?"
Questions: Market positioning, career trajectory, flexibility, placement risk
Red Flags: Hard-to-place attributes, narrow preferences
Strategy: Prove you're MARKETABLE + easy to place + will trust recruiter
```

**Example Differences**:

**Salary Discussion**:
- Company Recruiter: "What are your expectations?" (budget fit)
- Executive Recruiter: "What's your range?" (placement feasibility + commission calculation)

**Career Gap**:
- Company Recruiter: "Why the gap?" (concern for THIS role)
- Executive Recruiter: "What were you doing?" (market story for ALL future roles)

**Flexibility**:
- Company Recruiter: "Can you relocate to HQ?" (THIS job requirement)
- Executive Recruiter: "How flexible are you on location/industry/function?" (future placement potential)

**Conclusion**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **YES, we need ADAPTED strategy!**

---

## üéØ Architectural Decision

### Option 1: New Persona (Separate Flow)
**Architecture**: Create `Executive Recruiter` as distinct from `Company Recruiter`

```typescript
interview_questions_types: [
  'recruiter',           // Company recruiter
  'executive_recruiter', // NEW: Korn Ferry, etc.
  'hiring_manager',
  'panel',
  'technical'
]
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Tailored questions for each type
- ‚úÖ Future-proof (easy to add more types)

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Duplication (80% overlap with company recruiter)
- ‚ùå Maintenance burden (update both when core logic changes)
- ‚ùå User confusion ("Which recruiter type?")
- ‚ùå Database migration (new enum value)

**Complexity**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)  
**Value**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)  
**Risk**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium - duplication)

---

### Option 2: Context Flag (Adapt Existing)
**Architecture**: Add `isExecutiveSearch: boolean` context to existing `recruiter` type

```typescript
// Database: Add to jobs table
executive_search_firm: string | null  // "Korn Ferry", "Heidrick & Struggles", null

// Interview generation: Pass context
generateInterviewQuestions({
  roleType: 'recruiter',  // Same type!
  context: {
    isExecutiveSearch: job.executiveSearchFirm !== null,
    searchFirm: job.executiveSearchFirm,
    recruiterName: person.name,
  }
})

// Prompt: Adapt based on context
{
  {#if isExecutiveSearch}}
    You are preparing for a conversation with {{searchFirm}}, 
    an executive search firm. They evaluate through TWO lenses:
    1. Fit for THIS role ({{jobTitle}} at {{company}})
    2. Long-term relationship potential (future placements)
    
    CRITICAL DIFFERENCES:
    - They work for themselves (commissioned), not the company
    - They value marketability and placement probability
    - They're building a candidate pipeline (not just filling this role)
    - Red flags: Hard-to-place attributes, inflexibility
    
    Adapt your questions and guidance accordingly.
  {{else}}
    You are preparing for a conversation with {{company}}'s internal recruiter.
    They evaluate for fit with THIS specific role and company culture.
  {{/if}}
}
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **Minimal code change** (one boolean, conditional prompt)
- ‚úÖ **No duplication** (reuse existing logic)
- ‚úÖ **Easy to maintain** (single prompt file)
- ‚úÖ **No migration** (just add nullable column)
- ‚úÖ **Clear UX** (optional field, auto-adapts)

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly more complex prompt logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to test both paths

**Complexity**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low)  
**Value**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)  
**Risk**: ‚≠ê (Low)

---

### Option 3: Ignore Difference (Status Quo)
**Architecture**: Treat executive recruiter same as company recruiter

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Zero code change
- ‚úÖ Zero complexity

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Sub-optimal advice (misses strategic relationship aspect)
- ‚ùå Misses long-term value (staying on recruiter's radar)
- ‚ùå Not differentiated (generic advice)

**Complexity**: ‚≠ê (Minimal)  
**Value**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low)  
**Risk**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High - missed opportunity)

---

## üèÜ RECOMMENDATION: Option 2 (Context Flag)

### Why This Is The Right Choice

**1. Minimal Change, Maximum Value**
- ONE nullable field: `executive_search_firm`
- ONE conditional block in prompt
- ZERO new persona types
- ZERO code duplication

**2. Architectural Elegance**
```
Current: interview_type = 'recruiter'
         ‚Üí Same questions for all recruiters

Enhanced: interview_type = 'recruiter'
          + context.isExecutiveSearch = true/false
          ‚Üí Adapted questions based on context
```

**3. User Experience**
```
Job Creation/Edit:
[ ] Executive Search?
    ‚îî‚îÄ If yes: Which firm? [Korn Ferry      ‚ñº]
                           ‚îî‚îÄ Common firms dropdown
                           ‚îî‚îÄ Or type custom name
```

**4. Interview Prep Adaptation**
```
If executive search:
  ‚úÖ Add: "Building long-term relationship" guidance
  ‚úÖ Add: "Demonstrate marketability" questions
  ‚úÖ Add: "Stay on radar for future roles" strategies
  ‚úÖ Adjust: Red flag framing (placement risk vs job fit)
  ‚úÖ Include: Questions about recruiter's other openings

If company recruiter:
  ‚úÖ Keep: Current strategy (role-fit, culture-fit)
```

---

## üîß Implementation Plan

### Database Change (Minimal)

**Migration**: `db/migrations/009_executive_search.sql`
```sql
-- Add executive search firm tracking
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN executive_search_firm TEXT DEFAULT NULL;

-- Common firms for dropdown (optional table)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS executive_search_firms (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  website TEXT,
  specializations TEXT, -- JSON array: ["C-Suite", "Technology", "Healthcare"]
  usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Seed common firms
INSERT INTO executive_search_firms (id, name, website, specializations, created_at) VALUES
  ('kf', 'Korn Ferry', 'kornferry.com', '["C-Suite","Board","Technology"]', unixepoch()),
  ('hs', 'Heidrick & Struggles', 'heidrick.com', '["C-Suite","Board","Financial"]', unixepoch()),
  ('egon', 'Egon Zehnder', 'egonzehnder.com', '["C-Suite","Board","Private Equity"]', unixepoch()),
  ('spencer', 'Spencer Stuart', 'spencerstuart.com', '["C-Suite","Board","Nonprofit"]', unixepoch()),
  ('russell', 'Russell Reynolds', 'russellreynolds.com', '["C-Suite","Leadership","Healthcare"]', unixepoch());

-- Index for quick lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_jobs_executive_search ON jobs(executive_search_firm) WHERE executive_search_firm IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### UI Change (Minimal)

**Job Edit Form** (`app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` or edit modal):
```typescript
// Add after company/title fields
<div className="space-y-2">
  <label className="flex items-center gap-2 text-sm font-medium">
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={isExecutiveSearch}
      onChange={(e) => setIsExecutiveSearch(e.target.checked)}
    />
    Executive Search Firm Involved?
  </label>
  
  {isExecutiveSearch && (
    <div className="ml-6">
      <label className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        Search Firm Name
      </label>
      <select
        value={executiveSearchFirm}
        onChange={(e) => setExecutiveSearchFirm(e.target.value)}
        className="w-full mt-1 px-3 py-2 border rounded-lg"
      >
        <option value="">Select or type custom...</option>
        <option value="Korn Ferry">Korn Ferry</option>
        <option value="Heidrick & Struggles">Heidrick & Struggles</option>
        <option value="Egon Zehnder">Egon Zehnder</option>
        <option value="Spencer Stuart">Spencer Stuart</option>
        <option value="Russell Reynolds">Russell Reynolds</option>
        <option value="custom">Other (type below)</option>
      </select>
      
      {executiveSearchFirm === 'custom' && (
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Enter search firm name..."
          className="w-full mt-2 px-3 py-2 border rounded-lg"
        />
      )}
      
      <p className="mt-1 text-xs text-gray-500">
        üí° This helps us tailor interview prep for executive search dynamics
      </p>
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

**Visual Indicator** (Job card):
```typescript
{job.executiveSearchFirm && (
  <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 px-2 py-1 text-xs 
    bg-purple-100 dark:bg-purple-900/30 text-purple-700 dark:text-purple-300 rounded-full">
    <Briefcase size={12} />
    Via {job.executiveSearchFirm}
  </span>
)}
```

---

### Prompt Adaptation (Smart)

**File**: `prompts/interview-questions-recruiter.v1.md`

**Current** (lines ~20-30):
```markdown
# Interview Questions - Recruiter Screen

You are helping a candidate prepare for their RECRUITER SCREEN interview.

CONTEXT:
- Company: {{company_name}}
- Role: {{job_title}}
- Recruiter: {{recruiter_name}} ({{recruiter_title}})
```

**Enhanced** (add conditional section):
```markdown
# Interview Questions - Recruiter Screen

You are helping a candidate prepare for their RECRUITER SCREEN interview.

CONTEXT:
- Company: {{company_name}}
- Role: {{job_title}}
- Recruiter: {{recruiter_name}} ({{recruiter_title}})
{{#if executive_search_firm}}
- **Executive Search Firm**: {{executive_search_firm}}
{{/if}}

---

{{#if executive_search_firm}}
## üéØ EXECUTIVE SEARCH CONTEXT (CRITICAL!)

**This is NOT a typical company recruiter.** {{recruiter_name}} works for {{executive_search_firm}}, 
an executive search firm. This fundamentally changes the interview dynamics:

### Dual Evaluation Lens
The recruiter evaluates you through TWO perspectives simultaneously:

1. **IMMEDIATE PLACEMENT** (60% weight)
   - Can I place this candidate at {{company_name}} for {{job_title}}?
   - Does their background match the role requirements?
   - Will they pass the client ({{company_name}}) screening?
   
2. **LONG-TERM VALUE** (40% weight)
   - Is this candidate marketable for FUTURE roles?
   - Will they be a repeat client (easy to place)?
   - Should I keep them in my pipeline?

### What Executive Recruiters REALLY Care About

**Placement Probability** (Top Priority):
- Clear career narrative (easy to "sell" to clients)
- Flexible on role/industry/location (more opportunities)
- Realistic salary expectations (easier to place)
- Strong communication (client-ready)
- No "yellow flags" (hard-to-explain gaps, frequent job hopping)

**Candidate Quality**:
- Credential strength (brand names, achievements)
- Market demand (hot skills, rare expertise)
- Cultural adaptability (fits multiple environments)
- Long-term potential (promotable)

**Relationship Potential**:
- Professional demeanor (will they represent me well?)
- Responsiveness (easy to work with)
- Appreciation (will they refer others?)
- Trust (will they be honest about preferences?)

### Strategic Differences in This Interview

**Questions You'll Get** (Different from company recruiter):
- ‚úÖ "What's your ideal next role?" (flexibility gauge)
- ‚úÖ "Are you open to other industries/functions?" (future placement potential)
- ‚úÖ "What's your timeline?" (urgency vs patience)
- ‚úÖ "How did you find this role?" (sourcing effectiveness)
- ‚úÖ "Have you worked with search firms before?" (savviness check)

**Questions You WON'T Get** (Company recruiter asks these):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Deep culture-fit questions (client asks these later)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Detailed technical validation (hiring manager asks)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Team dynamics questions (panel asks)

### Your Strategic Objectives

**For THIS Role**:
1. Demonstrate fit for {{job_title}} at {{company_name}}
2. Show you're "client-ready" (won't embarrass the recruiter)
3. Validate you're worth the commission (serious candidate)

**For FUTURE Relationship**:
1. Show marketability (strong credentials, clear story)
2. Demonstrate flexibility (open to right opportunities)
3. Build trust (honest, professional, responsive)
4. Stay memorable (unique strengths, specific expertise)

**CRITICAL**: At end of interview, ASK:
> "Beyond this role, I'd value staying connected for future opportunities that match 
> my background in [X, Y, Z]. What's the best way to stay on your radar?"

This signals:
- You understand the executive search model
- You're thinking long-term
- You value the relationship beyond this role
- You're sophisticated (know how search firms work)

{{else}}
## üéØ COMPANY RECRUITER CONTEXT

{{recruiter_name}} works directly for {{company_name}}. Their goal is to find 
the best fit for THIS specific role and company culture.

Focus on demonstrating:
- Strong fit for THIS role
- Alignment with {{company_name}}'s culture
- Enthusiasm for THIS opportunity specifically

{{/if}}

---

## üìã QUESTION GENERATION STRATEGY

{{#if executive_search_firm}}
### For Executive Search Recruiter

**Phase 1: Warm-up** (Build rapport + assess marketability)
- Background story (clear narrative?)
- Career trajectory (logical progression?)
- Current situation (why looking?)
- **ADDED**: "Have you worked with search firms before?"
- **ADDED**: "What's your ideal next role beyond this one?"

**Phase 2: Role Fit** (Can I place them at {{company_name}}?)
- Skills validation (matches JD?)
- Experience relevance (background fits?)
- Culture considerations (will they mesh?)
- **ADJUSTED**: Less deep dive (client will do this)

**Phase 3: Placement Feasibility** (Can I successfully place this person?)
- Salary expectations (realistic? flexible?)
- Timeline (urgent? patient?)
- Location flexibility (open to relocation/remote?)
- **ADDED**: "What other types of roles are you considering?"
- **ADDED**: "How do you evaluate opportunities?"

**Phase 4: Relationship Building** (Should I keep them in my pipeline?)
- Long-term career goals (ambitious? clear direction?)
- Industry preferences (narrow? broad?)
- Values and priorities (what matters most?)
- **ADDED**: "What makes a role the 'right' role for you?"

**Phase 5: Close** (Secure the relationship)
- Questions for recruiter (engaged?)
- Next steps clarity (process understanding?)
- **ADDED**: "Beyond this role, how can we stay connected?"
- **ADDED**: Thank the recruiter (appreciate their advocacy)

{{else}}
### For Company Recruiter

**Phase 1-5**: [Existing strategy - unchanged]

{{/if}}
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ **Minimal change** (one conditional block in prompt)
- ‚úÖ **No duplication** (reuse existing logic)
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible** (existing jobs work unchanged)
- ‚úÖ **Future-proof** (easy to add more context)
- ‚úÖ **Smart adaptation** (same questions + strategic overlay)

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Prompt slightly more complex
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to test both paths

**Complexity**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low)  
**Value**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)  
**Risk**: ‚≠ê (Very Low)

---

### Option 3: Post-Generation Augmentation
**Architecture**: Generate standard recruiter questions, then ADD executive-specific guidance

```typescript
// Generate base questions (existing logic)
const baseQuestions = await generateInterviewQuestions('recruiter', ...);

// If executive search, augment with additional guidance
if (job.executiveSearchFirm) {
  return {
    ...baseQuestions,
    executiveSearchGuidance: {
      firmContext: `You're speaking with ${job.executiveSearchFirm}...`,
      additionalQuestions: [
        "What other opportunities are you exploring?",
        "How flexible are you on role/industry/location?",
        "Have you worked with executive search firms before?"
      ],
      strategicTips: [
        "Build relationship beyond this role",
        "Demonstrate marketability and flexibility",
        "Ask about staying on their radar for future roles"
      ],
      closingAdvice: "At interview end, ask: 'Beyond this role, what's the best way to stay connected for future opportunities?'"
    }
  };
}
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Clean separation (core questions + augmentation)
- ‚úÖ Easy to test (augmentation is additive)
- ‚úÖ Flexible (can disable augmentation easily)

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Questions and guidance separated (less integrated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Two AI calls (inefficient) OR hardcoded guidance (less dynamic)

**Complexity**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium)  
**Value**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Good)  
**Risk**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low-Medium)

---

## üéØ FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Option 2 (Context Flag)

### Implementation Summary

**Database** (5 minutes):
```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN executive_search_firm TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
```

**UI** (15 minutes):
- Add checkbox: "Executive Search Firm Involved?"
- Add dropdown/input: Firm name (Korn Ferry, etc.)
- Add badge on job card: "Via Korn Ferry"

**Prompt** (30 minutes):
- Add conditional block in `interview-questions-recruiter.v1.md`
- Include executive search context (motivations, evaluation, strategy)
- Adapt questions (add 3-5 executive-specific questions)
- Add closing guidance (staying on radar)

**API** (5 minutes):
- Pass `executive_search_firm` to prompt variables
- Compute `isExecutiveSearch` boolean

**Testing** (15 minutes):
- Test with FuelCell (has Korn Ferry)
- Test with Fortive (no search firm)
- Verify questions differ appropriately

**Total Time**: ~70 minutes (1 hour 10 minutes)

---

## üéì Key Strategic Insights

### What Makes Executive Search Different

**1. The Recruiter's Real Clients**
- Primary: The company (FuelCell) - pays the fee
- Secondary: The candidate (you) - repeat business potential
- Conflict: Must satisfy both!

**2. Commission Structure**
- Typical: 25-33% of first year salary
- For $200K role: $50-65K commission
- Motivation: Place successfully (not just screen)

**3. Pipeline Economics**
- They maintain candidate databases
- High-quality candidates = valuable asset
- Even if THIS role doesn't work out, NEXT role might
- Smart candidates cultivate these relationships

### Interview Strategy Adaptation

**Standard Recruiter Strategy**:
```
Goal: Prove you're the best fit for THIS ROLE
Focus: Role requirements, company culture, this opportunity
Tone: Enthusiastic, specific, committed to THIS company
```

**Executive Search Strategy**:
```
Goal: Prove you're PLACEABLE + valuable for LONG-TERM
Focus: Marketability, flexibility, career trajectory, relationship
Tone: Professional, strategic, open to right opportunities, relationship-building
```

**Example Response Differences**:

**Question**: "Why are you looking to leave your current role?"

**To Company Recruiter**:
> "I'm excited about {{company_name}}'s mission in [specific area]. 
> This role perfectly aligns with my background in [X] and my career goal of [Y]."
(Specific to THIS company)

**To Executive Recruiter**:
> "I've accomplished [key achievements] in my current role and I'm ready for the next challenge. 
> I'm particularly interested in opportunities where I can [value proposition] at companies 
> innovating in [industry/domain]. This role at {{company_name}} fits that criteria well, 
> and I'd be open to discussing other similar opportunities you're working on."
(Shows fit for THIS role + openness to OTHERS)

## üìä Value Analysis

### Without This Feature
- ‚ùå Generic recruiter prep (one-size-fits-all)
- ‚ùå Misses long-term relationship opportunity
- ‚ùå Doesn't address executive search dynamics
- ‚ùå Candidate sounds like junior candidate (not executive-level)

### With This Feature
- ‚úÖ Tailored prep (executive search aware)
- ‚úÖ Builds relationship beyond this role
- ‚úÖ Addresses dual evaluation lens
- ‚úÖ Candidate sounds sophisticated and strategic

### ROI Calculation
```
Value of staying on Korn Ferry's radar:
- Average recruiter places 10-15 executives/year
- Each executive makes $150-300K
- Being in their "A-list" pipeline = access to hidden market

Opportunity Cost of NOT building relationship:
- Miss 10-15 opportunities per year
- Many never publicly posted
- Network effect (recruiters know recruiters)

Implementation Cost:
- 70 minutes of development
- One migration
- Minimal maintenance

ROI: MASSIVE (access to hidden executive job market)
```

---

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Minimal Implementation (TODAY - 70 min)
1. Add `executive_search_firm` column to jobs table
2. Add UI checkbox + dropdown in job edit
3. Update recruiter prompt with conditional logic
4. Test with FuelCell (Korn Ferry) vs Fortive (direct)

### Phase 2: Enhancement (LATER - optional)
1. Create `executive_search_firms` reference table
2. Add firm specializations (C-Suite, Tech, Healthcare)
3. Track which firms place candidates successfully
4. Add "Recruiter Relationship" section to Coach Mode

### Phase 3: Advanced (FUTURE - if high value)
1. Firm-specific intelligence (research Korn Ferry's style)
2. Recruiter-specific prep (research individual recruiter)
3. Relationship tracking (follow-ups, thank-yous)
4. Pipeline optimization (which firms to cultivate)

---

## üí° Architectural Principles Applied

### 1. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't build firm intelligence NOW
- Don't create new persona type NOW
- Add complexity only when proven valuable

### 2. Single Responsibility
- Job table: Store firm name (data)
- Prompt: Adapt strategy (logic)
- UI: Collect input (interface)
- Each does ONE thing well

### 3. Open/Closed Principle
- Open: Can add more context (isRemote, isBoardRole, etc.)
- Closed: Don't modify existing recruiter logic
- Extend via context, don't rewrite

### 4. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Reuse existing recruiter prompt
- Add conditional blocks (not duplicate prompts)
- Share 80% of logic, adapt 20%

### 5. Minimal Viable Solution
- One boolean check
- One conditional block
- Maximum value, minimum code

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

### Answer to Your Questions

**Q1: Is executive recruiter a new persona?**
- **Architecturally**: No, it's a CONTEXT VARIATION of existing 'recruiter' persona
- **Functionally**: Yes, they need different guidance
- **Implementation**: Context flag (not new persona)

**Q2: Do we need to change strategy?**
- **Yes**: Add dual-lens evaluation (placement + relationship)
- **How**: Conditional blocks in existing prompt
- **Impact**: 40% of interview strategy should address long-term value

**Q3: Minimalistic change?**
- **Database**: 1 column (`executive_search_firm`)
- **UI**: 1 checkbox + 1 dropdown (optional)
- **Prompt**: 1 conditional block (~50 lines)
- **Total**: 70 minutes implementation

**Q4: Will it help users succeed?**
- **Short-term**: Better prep for executive search dynamics
- **Long-term**: Access to hidden job market via recruiter relationships
- **ROI**: MASSIVE (hidden market > public market for executives)
