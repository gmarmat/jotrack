# Comprehensive Lifecycle E2E Testing Strategy
## Application Coach + Interview Coach Integration Testing

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Goal**: Test complete user journey across BOTH coach modes to ensure no interference  
**Current Status**: Interview Coach implemented, 2/8 tests passing, ready for full lifecycle testing

---

## üéØ Testing Philosophy

### Why Test Both Coaches Together?

1. **Data Isolation**: Ensure Application Coach and Interview Coach don't corrupt each other's data
2. **State Transitions**: Verify smooth handoff from Application Coach ‚Üí Interview Coach
3. **Shared Resources**: Test that both coaches can access shared data (Resume, JD, Company Intel)
4. **Real User Flow**: Mimic actual user behavior from job creation ‚Üí getting hired

---

## üìã Complete User Lifecycle Journey Map

### Phase 1: Job Discovery (No Coach)
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes  
**Actions**:
1. User creates new job
2. Uploads resume
3. Uploads job description
4. Adds company URL
5. Marks status as "ON_RADAR"

**What to Test**:
- ‚úÖ Job creation successful
- ‚úÖ File uploads work
- ‚úÖ No coach mode entry points visible yet

---

### Phase 2: Pre-Application (Application Coach)
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes  
**Actions**:
1. User clicks "Activate Coach Mode"
2. Completes Discovery Wizard (15-16 questions, 4 batches)
3. Reviews generated profile
4. Views initial match score
5. Iterates on resume (optimize button)
6. Re-calculates score (should improve)
7. Generates cover letter
8. Reviews final score
9. Clicks "I've Applied"

**What to Test**:
- ‚úÖ Discovery wizard auto-saves between batches
- ‚úÖ All 15-16 questions generated
- ‚úÖ Profile analysis completes
- ‚úÖ Match score calculates correctly
- ‚úÖ Resume optimization works
- ‚úÖ Score recalculation shows improvement
- ‚úÖ Cover letter generates
- ‚úÖ "I've Applied" transitions to post-app phase
- ‚úÖ Application Coach data persists (writing style, discovery, profile)

---

### Phase 3: Post-Application, Pre-Interview (Waiting)
**Duration**: 1-14 days (simulated instantly in E2E)  
**Actions**:
1. User marks status as "APPLIED"
2. Interview Questions section appears
3. User clicks "Search Web" for questions
4. User clicks "Generate AI Questions" for 3 personas
5. User reviews questions but doesn't start Interview Coach yet

**What to Test**:
- ‚úÖ Status change doesn't break Application Coach data
- ‚úÖ Interview Questions section visible
- ‚úÖ Web search works (Tavily)
- ‚úÖ AI question generation works (3 personas)
- ‚úÖ Questions cached correctly (90-day TTL)

3. **Questions Tab**: Selects 8-10 questions to practice
4. **Practice Tab**: 
   - Drafts first answer (weak, ~50 words)
   - Submits for scoring ‚Üí Gets 42/100
   - Reads feedback + 4 follow-up questions
   - Answers follow-ups
   - Re-submits ‚Üí Gets 78/100
   - Clicks "Generate STAR Talk Track"
   - Reviews long-form + cheat sheet versions
5. Repeats for 2 more questions (total: 3 talk tracks)
6. **Core Stories Tab**:
   - Clicks "Extract Core Stories"
   - AI identifies 2 stories

### Phase 5: Post-Interview (Optional Future)
**Duration**: Variable  
**Actions**:
1. User marks status as "INTERVIEW_COMPLETED"
2. User adds interview feedback notes
3. User tracks follow-up actions

**What to Test** (Future):
- ‚úÖ Status transitions preserve all data
- ‚úÖ Notes system works
- ‚úÖ Both coaches remain accessible

## üß™ E2E Test Suite Structure

### File: `e2e/complete-lifecycle.spec.ts`

```typescript
test.describe('Complete User Lifecycle - Both Coaches', () => {
  let jobId: string;
  
  test.beforeAll(async () => {
    // Minimal setup - let tests create their own data
    jobId = `lifecycle-test-${Date.now()}`;
  });
  
  test.afterAll(async () => {
    // Cleanup
    await cleanupJob(jobId);
  });
  
  // Tests run sequentially to simulate real user flow
  test.describe.serial('Phase 1: Job Discovery', () => {
    // L1-01 through L1-05
  });
  
  test.describe.serial('Phase 2: Application Coach', () => {
    // L2-01 through L2-15
  });
  
  test.describe.serial('Phase 3: Post-Application', () => {
    // L3-01 through L3-05
  });
  
  test.describe.serial('Phase 4: Interview Coach', () => {
    // L4-01 through L4-10
  });
  
  test('L5-01: Final Data Integrity Check', () => {
    // Verify ALL data still intact
  });
});
```

## üîß Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Create Shared Fixtures (2 hours)
```typescript
// e2e/fixtures/complete-lifecycle.ts

export async function createJob(page: Page): Promise<string> {
  // Navigate to home, create job
  // Return jobId
}

export async function uploadDocuments(page: Page, jobId: string) {
  // Upload resume + JD
}

export async function completeDiscoveryWizard(page: Page) {
  // Answer all 15-16 questions across 4 batches
}

export async function optimizeResumeAndRecalculate(page: Page) {
  // Optimize resume, wait for AI, recalculate score
}

export async function generateInterviewQuestions(page: Page, jobId: string) {
  // Search web + generate AI questions
}

export async function completeInterviewPrepFlow(page: Page) {
  // Draft answer ‚Üí score ‚Üí iterate ‚Üí talk track (3x)
}

export async function extractCoreStories(page: Page) {
  // Extract 2-3 core stories, verify mapping
}

export async function verifyDataIntegrity(jobId: string) {
  // Query DB, verify all data intact
}
```

### Step 2: Write Sequential Tests (4 hours)
- One test file: `e2e/complete-lifecycle.spec.ts`
- Use `test.describe.serial` to enforce order
- Each phase builds on previous phase's data
- Rich logging for debugging

### Step 3: Add Data Verification (2 hours)
- After each major action, verify DB state
- Check for data leaks between coaches
- Verify timestamps are consistent
- Ensure no orphaned records

### Step 4: Add Error Scenarios (2 hours)
- Test navigation away mid-flow
- Test browser refresh at critical points
- Test concurrent sessions (2 windows, same job)
- Test API failures (mock network errors)

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Green Light to Ship
- [ ] All 35 tests pass
- [ ] Application Coach ‚Üí Interview Coach handoff seamless
- [ ] No data corruption detected
- [ ] All timestamps valid (Unix seconds, not milliseconds)
- [ ] No memory leaks (check DB size growth)
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<30 min total test time)

### Data Integrity Checks
```sql
-- After full lifecycle, verify:
SELECT 
  j.id,
  j.status,
  cs.data_json IS NOT NULL as has_app_coach,
  cs.interview_coach_json IS NOT NULL as has_interview_coach,
  LENGTH(cs.data_json) as app_coach_size,
  LENGTH(cs.interview_coach_json) as interview_coach_size,
  jiq.recruiter_questions IS NOT NULL as has_questions
FROM jobs j
LEFT JOIN coach_state cs ON j.id = cs.job_id
LEFT JOIN job_interview_questions jiq ON j.id = jiq.job_id
WHERE j.id = 'test-job-id';

-- Expected result:
-- has_app_coach: 1
-- has_interview_coach: 1
-- app_coach_size: >5000 (has writing style, discovery)
-- interview_coach_size: >2000 (has answers, stories)
-- has_questions: 1
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Question Loading Timeout (IC-03)
**Status**: Currently failing  
**Root Cause**: QuestionSelection component not rendering data-testid correctly  
**Workaround**: Skip question selection tests, use manual testing  
**Fix**: Add data-testid to question cards in QuestionSelection.tsx

### Issue 2: AI Call Timeouts
**Status**: Not yet tested in full lifecycle  
**Risk**: High - AI calls can take 5-10 seconds  
**Mitigation**: Use generous timeouts (30s for AI, 15s for UI)

### Issue 3: Parallel Test Execution
**Status**: Current tests run in parallel, causing ID collisions  
**Solution**: Use `test.describe.serial` for lifecycle tests

| Write lifecycle tests | 4 hours | üî≤ Not started |
| Data verification | 2 hours | üî≤ Not started |
| Error scenarios | 2 hours | üî≤ Not started |
| Debug & stabilize | 3 hours | üî≤ Not started |
| **Total** | **15 hours** | |

## üöÄ Recommendation

### Option A: Complete Current E2E Fixes (2 hours)
- Fix QuestionSelection data-testid issue
- Get all 8 Interview Coach tests passing
- Then write lifecycle tests

### Option B: Move to Demo First, E2E Later (Recommended)
- Create comprehensive demo walkthrough NOW
- Show working feature to stakeholders
- Finish E2E tests in next session
- **Rationale**: Core feature works (IC-01, IC-02 pass), demo provides immediate value

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)
- Create demo walkthrough (1 hour)
- Fix critical E2E issues in parallel (2 hours)
- Have both by end of session
