## ‚ùå What's BROKEN

### **Bug #1: Database Migration Not Run** üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Severity**: P0 - CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Profile analysis crashes
- **Error**: `SqliteError: no such table: job_profiles`
- **Root Cause**: Migration `010_coach_mode_v1.sql` was never executed on `jotrack.db`
- **What Happened**:
  1. User completes discovery questions ‚úÖ
  2. Clicks "Complete Discovery" ‚úÖ
  3. AI analyzes responses successfully ‚úÖ
  4. AI extracts profile data ‚úÖ
  5. **CRASH**: Tries to insert into `job_profiles` table that doesn't exist ‚ùå
- **AI Analysis Output** (before crash):
  ```
  ‚úÖ Profile analysis complete: 7 skills, 3 projects, 3 achievements
  üìä Profile completeness: 75%
  üéØ Gaps filled: 2 / 7
  ```
  **BUT THEN**:
  ```
  ‚ùå Profile analysis failed: SqliteError: no such table: job_profiles
  ```
- **User Experience**: Error dialog: "Failed to analyze profile"
- **Fix Applied**: Manually created tables using `sqlite3` CLI
- **Verification**: Tables now exist:
  ```
  job_profiles ‚úÖ
  coach_sessions ‚úÖ
  company_interview_questions ‚úÖ
  talk_tracks ‚úÖ
  ```
- **Status**: **FIXED** (but needs proper migration runner)

---

### **Bug #2: Discovery Responses Not Persisting** üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Severity**: P0 - CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Data loss on page refresh
- **What Happened**:
  1. User answers 3 questions (Q1, Q2, Q4) ‚úÖ
  2. Skips 13 questions ‚úÖ
  3. Progress shows "3 answered, 13 skipped" ‚úÖ
  4. **Page Reload** (to retry after Bug #1 fix)
  5. **ALL ANSWERS LOST** ‚ùå
  6. UI resets to initial state: "Generate Discovery Questions" button
- **Root Cause**: Discovery responses only saved to component state, not persisted to database
- **Expected Behavior**: 
  - Answers should save to `/api/coach/[jobId]/save` endpoint
  - On page load, should load from database
  - User can resume where they left off
- **Actual Behavior**:
  - Answers lost on refresh
  - Must start over
- **User Impact**: **SEVERE** - User loses 15-20 minutes of work
- **Fix Needed**: 
  1. Save each answer immediately to database
  2. Load saved responses on mount
  3. Populate discovery wizard with existing answers
- **Status**: **NOT FIXED** - Requires backend work

### **User Responses - Marcus's Answers**

**Q1 Response** (Leadership Initiative):
```
At CloudTech, I led our backend team of 5 engineers through a major system 
redesign. We were facing performance issues with our API taking 800ms per 
request, and I took the initiative to coordinate the team to redesign our 
architecture. I held daily standups, divided work into manageable chunks, and 
personally mentored junior developers on best practices. We reduced response 
time from 800ms to 200ms‚Äîa 75% improvement. The system now serves 50,000 
daily users with 99.9% uptime.
```
- Word count: 77 words ‚úÖ
- Metrics included: 5 engineers, 800ms‚Üí200ms, 75% improvement, 50K users ‚úÖ
- STAR format: Situation (perf issues), Task (redesign), Action (standups, mentoring), Result (75% faster) ‚úÖ
- **Quality**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Excellent response with quantified achievements

**Q2 Response** (Team Coordination):
```
At CloudTech, I coordinated a cross-functional team to resolve a critical 
database performance bottleneck. The problem affected multiple services and 
required input from backend engineers, database admins, and frontend developers. 
I organized daily sync meetings, created a shared Slack channel for rapid 
communication, and built a prioritized backlog. My approach was to break the 
problem into smaller pieces, assign clear ownership, and unblock dependencies 
quickly. We reduced query times from 2-3 seconds to under 100ms, directly 
impacting 50,000 users. The team praised the clear coordination and communication 
structure.
```
- Word count: 88 words ‚úÖ
- Metrics: 3s‚Üí100ms (95% improvement), 50K users ‚úÖ
- Cross-functional coordination demonstrated ‚úÖ
- **Quality**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Excellent, shows leadership without title

**Q4 Response** (Stakeholder Management):
```
At my previous role, I needed buy-in from the DevOps team to adopt a new 
deployment pipeline I designed. They were skeptical because it meant changing 
their established workflow. I scheduled one-on-ones to understand their concerns, 
then created a proof-of-concept that addressed their specific pain points. I 
showed them how it would save them 2 hours per week and reduce deployment 
failures by 60%. By involving them early, listening to their feedback, and 
demonstrating clear benefits, I gained their full support. The new pipeline was 
adopted company-wide within 3 months.
```
- Word count: 90 words ‚úÖ
- Metrics: 2 hrs/week saved, 60% fewer failures, company-wide adoption ‚úÖ
- Influence without authority demonstrated ‚úÖ
- **Quality**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Perfect stakeholder management example
