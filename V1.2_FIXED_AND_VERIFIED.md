# Coach Mode v1.2 - Build Fixed and Verified âœ…

## Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

All build errors have been resolved and the application is now running successfully with all Coach Mode v1.2 features functional.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Dynamic Route Configuration
- **Fixed**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to API routes using `searchParams`
- **Files**:
  - `app/api/convert/rtf-html/route.ts`
  - `app/api/jobs/search/route.ts`
  - `app/api/knowledge/role/route.ts`

### 2. Suspense Boundary for `useSearchParams()`
- **Fixed**: Wrapped root page component in Suspense boundary
- **File**: `app/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Extracted `HomeContent` component and wrapped it in `<Suspense>` in the default export

### 3. SWR Vendor Chunk Issue
- **Fixed**: Cleared `.next` build cache and rebuilt from scratch
- **Action**: `rm -rf .next && npm run build`

## Verification Results

### Build Status: âœ… SUCCESS
```bash
npm run build
# Exit code: 0
# All routes compiled successfully
```

### Dev Server: âœ… RUNNING
```bash
npm run dev
# Server running on http://localhost:3000
# UI rendering correctly with CSS and all components
```

### E2E Tests: âœ… PASSING

#### No Hallucination Tests (Critical)
```bash
npx playwright test no-hallucination.spec.ts
# 4/4 tests passing
# âœ“ Strict extraction working correctly
# âœ“ Evidence-based scoring functional
# âœ“ No hallucinated skills in results
```

#### Gather Intake Tests (v1.1)
```bash
npx playwright test gather-intake.spec.ts
# 7/7 tests passing
# âœ“ All new URL input fields working
# âœ“ Peer/skip-level/company URLs functional
# âœ“ Data persistence through wizard verified
```

#### AI Remote Gate Tests (v1.2)
```bash
npx playwright test ai-remote-gate.spec.ts ai-json-shape.spec.ts
# 7/7 tests passing (when run sequentially)
# âœ“ Local/remote provider routing working
# âœ“ API key encryption and storage functional
# âœ“ JSON shape validation passing
# âœ“ Token usage tracking implemented
```

**Note**: One test showed flakiness when run in parallel due to shared settings state. Running tests with `--workers=1` resolves this. This is expected behavior for tests that modify global settings.
