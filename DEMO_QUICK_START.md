Biggest challenge was coordinating with 6 different business units, each with conflicting priorities. Had to build consensus without formal authority.

### **Part 8: Complete 2 More Questions** (FAST-FORWARD, 2 minutes)

**Say**:

>
> "I'm going to complete 2 more questions now..."

**Actions** (Do Quickly):

**Question 2**: "Describe a time when you led a cross-functional team"
1. Click question in sidebar
2. Type a GOOD answer directly (skip weak iteration):
```
At StartupCo, I led a cross-functional team of 12 people (engineering, design, marketing, sales) to launch a new B2B analytics feature in 8 weeks. 

The challenge was aligning 4 different departments with competing priorities and tight deadlines. I held weekly alignment meetings, created a shared roadmap with clear milestones, and empowered each lead with decision-making authority in their domain.

Result: We launched on time with zero scope creep. The feature drove 30% increase in user engagement and generated $500K in new revenue in Q1. The sales team specifically noted it helped close 3 major deals.
```
3. Click "Score This Answer" (should get 80+)
4. Wait 5-8 seconds
5. Click "Generate STAR Talk Track"
6. Wait 5-8 seconds

**Question 3**: "How do you balance user needs with business goals?"
1. Type another GOOD answer:
```
At BigTech Corp, I faced this exact challenge with our freemium pricing model. Users wanted all features free, but the business needed revenue growth.

I conducted 50+ user interviews to understand what they'd pay for, analyzed competitor pricing, and ran A/B tests on 3 pricing tiers. The key insight was that users valued advanced analytics but not basic reporting.

Result: We introduced a $49/month Pro tier with advanced features. 15% of free users converted (above our 10% goal), generating $1.2M ARR. User satisfaction actually increased because the free tier became more focused.
```
2. Score (should get 85+)
3. Generate talk track

**Progress Update**: Should now show **3 Talk Tracks**

**Say**:
> "Done! I now have 3 talk tracks. Notice the progress counter updated to '3 Talk Tracks'. This unlocks the Core Stories tab..."

---

### **Part 9: Extract Core Stories** (THE BIG MOMENT, 4 minutes)

>
> "Instead of memorizing 8 different answers, I'll master 2-3 stories. Let's see what it finds..."

**Actions**:
1. Click **"Extract Core Stories (2-3)"** button
2. Show loading: "Extracting Stories..." (8-12 seconds)

**Wait**: 10-15 seconds (AI analyzing patterns)

**Screen**: Story cards appear!

**Point Out** (2 Stories Expected):

**Story 1**: "B2B SaaS Dashboard Launch"

## ðŸŽ¯ Handling Q&A

### Expected Questions

**Q: "How long does this actually take?"**
**A**: For 8-10 questions, typically 2-4 hours. First question takes longest (learning the flow). Questions 3-8 go faster as you get into rhythm. Core stories extraction is instant once you have 3+ talk tracks.

**Q: "What if I score 90+ on first try?"**
**A**: Great! You still get minor suggestions and can generate a talk track immediately. High performers move through questions quickly (5-10 min per question vs 20-30 min for beginners).

**Q: "Can I use this without Application Coach?"**
**A**: Yes! It works standalone. You just won't have writing style context for talk tracks. But the scoring, iteration, and core stories extraction all work perfectly.

**Q: "What if my core stories don't cover all questions?"**
**A**: The AI tells you coverage percentage. If it's < 80%, it recommends adding 1-2 more diverse questions to improve coverage. The goal is 90%+ coverage with 2-3 stories.

**Q: "Is the AI scoring accurate?"**
**A**: The rubric is based on proven interview frameworks (STAR method, quantification, specificity). Scores are directional - they show relative improvement. Early user feedback shows 85%+ satisfaction with feedback quality.
