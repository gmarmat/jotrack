# P0 Test Fix Strategy - FINAL
**Root Cause**: Mock API returns empty state instead of saved data  
**Impact**: Persistence broken, all downstream tests fail  
**Confidence**: 99% (clear evidence)

---

## 🎯 **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED**

### The Bug
File: `e2e/mocks/coachModeAiMocks.ts:387-394`

```typescript
} else {
  // GET request - return empty state (will load from DB)
  await route.fulfill({
    status: 200,
    contentType: 'application/json',
    body: JSON.stringify({ 
      success: true,
      state: {},  // ← BUG: Empty state breaks persistence!
    }),
  });
}
```

### Why It Fails
1. ✅ Test generates questions (POST mock works)
2. ✅ Test types answer (UI works)
3. ✅ Auto-save triggers (POST to `/api/coach/*/save`)
4. ✅ POST mock returns `{ success: true }`
5. ✅ Page refreshes
6. ✅ Page tries to load state (GET from `/api/coach/*/save`)
7. ❌ GET mock returns `{ state: {} }` - EMPTY!
8. ❌ Wizard doesn't appear (no saved questions)
9. ❌ Test fails waiting for wizard

### Cascade Effect
- P0-07 fails → No persistence
- P0-10 fails → Can't complete discovery (wizard state lost)
- P0-12 fails → Can't reach resume (Score tab stays locked)
- P0-13 fails → Can't reach cover letter (Resume tab stays locked)

**All 4 failures stem from ONE bug!**

## 🛠️ **FIX STRATEGY**

### Option A: Un-Mock the Save Endpoint (BEST)
**Rationale**: Let tests use REAL database for persistence  
**Pros**:
- Tests verify real persistence logic
- No need for stateful mocks
- More realistic test scenario
- Simpler implementation

**Cons**:
- Slightly slower (DB I/O)
- Need to clean DB between tests (already doing this)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In setupCoachModeApiMocks(), REMOVE this route:
await page.route('**/api/coach/*/save**', ...) // ← DELETE THIS

// Keep all other mocks (generate-discovery, analyze-profile, etc.)
```

**Result**: Tests will:
1. Save to real DB via POST
2. Load from real DB via GET
3. Persistence actually works!

---

### Option B: Make Mock Stateful (COMPLEX)
**Rationale**: Keep mocking but save state in memory  
**Pros**:
- Faster (no DB I/O)
- Fully isolated

**Cons**:
- Complex implementation (need shared state object)
- State persists across tests (pollution risk)
- Doesn't test real persistence logic

**Implementation**: (Not recommended)

---

## ✅ **CHOSEN SOLUTION: Option A**

### Why Option A Wins
1. **Simpler**: Just remove one route
2. **More accurate**: Tests real persistence
3. **Safer**: No stateful mocks to manage
4. **Faster to implement**: 2 min vs 20 min

---

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### Step 1: Remove Save Endpoint Mock (2 min)
```typescript
// File: e2e/mocks/coachModeAiMocks.ts
// DELETE lines 375-396 (the save route mock)
```

### Step 2: Verify (5 min)
```bash
# Run P0-07 in isolation
npx playwright test e2e/coach-mode-critical.spec.ts:195
```

**Expected**: ✅ PASS (wizard persists after refresh)

### Step 3: Run Full P0 Suite (5 min)
```bash
npx playwright test coach-mode-critical.spec.ts
```

**Expected**: 85%+ (17/20) - back to baseline!

### Step 4: Verify ui-polish Still Works (5 min)
```bash
npx playwright test ui-polish-complete.spec.ts
```

**Expected**: 92% (24/26) - no regression

**Total Time**: 17 minutes

## 🎯 **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### Before Fix
- P0 Tests: 75% (15/20)
- P0-07: ❌ FAIL (persistence broken)
- P0-10, P0-12, P0-13: ❌ FAIL (cascade)

### After Fix
- P0 Tests: 85%+ (17/20) ← Back to baseline!
- P0-07: ✅ PASS (real persistence works)
- P0-10: ✅ PASS (Score unlocks)
- P0-12: ✅ PASS (Resume generates)
- P0-13: ✅ PASS (Cover letter generates)

### ui-polish Tests
- Before: 92% (24/26)
- After: 92% (24/26) ← NO CHANGE
