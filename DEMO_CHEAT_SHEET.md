## 📝 Copy-Paste Answers (Ready to Use)

### Weak Answer (26 words)
```
I have experience leading product teams. I worked on several launches. We had some challenges but overcame them. I'm good at prioritizing features and working with stakeholders.
```

### Follow-Up Answers (4 responses)

**Q1: What specific product?**
```
I led the launch of Fortive's B2B SaaS dashboard for supply chain management. The product helped manufacturers track inventory in real-time across 50+ locations.
```

**Q2: What metrics?**
```
User adoption: 0 to 10,000 DAU in 6 months. Customer retention: 85% (above industry average of 70%). Revenue: $2M ARR in first year.
```

**Q3: Team size and role?**
```
I was Product Lead with a team of 3 PMs, 8 engineers (5 backend, 3 frontend), 2 designers, and 1 data analyst. Reported directly to VP of Product.
```

**Q4: What was challenging?**
```
Biggest challenge was coordinating with 6 different business units, each with conflicting priorities. Had to build consensus without formal authority.
```

### Good Answer #2 (Cross-functional team)
```
At StartupCo, I led a cross-functional team of 12 people (engineering, design, marketing, sales) to launch a new B2B analytics feature in 8 weeks. 

The challenge was aligning 4 different departments with competing priorities and tight deadlines. I held weekly alignment meetings, created a shared roadmap with clear milestones, and empowered each lead with decision-making authority in their domain.

Result: We launched on time with zero scope creep. The feature drove 30% increase in user engagement and generated $500K in new revenue in Q1. The sales team specifically noted it helped close 3 major deals.
```

### Good Answer #3 (User needs vs business goals)
```
At BigTech Corp, I faced this exact challenge with our freemium pricing model. Users wanted all features free, but the business needed revenue growth.

I conducted 50+ user interviews to understand what they'd pay for, analyzed competitor pricing, and ran A/B tests on 3 pricing tiers. The key insight was that users valued advanced analytics but not basic reporting.

Result: We introduced a $49/month Pro tier with advanced features. 15% of free users converted (above our 10% goal), generating $1.2M ARR. User satisfaction actually increased because the free tier became more focused.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Banner Not Visible
- Scroll down to bottom of page
- Verify job status is "APPLIED" (not "ON_RADAR")
- Refresh page

### If Questions Don't Load
- Go back to job page
- Generate interview questions first
- Then return to Interview Coach

### If AI Times Out
- Wait 30 seconds
- Try again (has retry logic)
- If still fails: Show pre-recorded demo

### If Score Seems Wrong
- That's okay! AI scores vary slightly

- The feedback is what matters
