## 📋 WHAT'S NOT IMPLEMENTED YET

These are intentionally NOT in this build (future enhancements):

1. **3-Level Skill Bars** - Component created but not wired to AI
2. **Match Matrix Categories** - Expand All button (can add based on feedback)
3. **Modular AI Buttons** - Per-section analyze (Company/People have buttons, not wired yet)
4. **Visual Animations** - Shimmer, pulse effects (polish phase)
5. **Hierarchical Context** - AI analyses feeding each other (advanced feature)

**Why**: We focused on core UX improvements and data safety first. The above can be added iteratively based on your feedback.

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READINESS

**Build Status**:
- ✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
- ✅ ESLint: All passing
- ✅ Build: Successful
- ✅ Hot Reload: Working
- ✅ Database: Migrated

**Production Ready Features**:
- Global settings (all functionality working)
- Auto-save (full implementation)
- Auto-populate (works with existing attachments)
- AI branding (consistent everywhere)
- New sections (rendering with sample/actual data)

**Known Limitations**:
- Company/People analyze buttons are placeholders (will wire to AI in next phase)
- 3-level skills component exists but needs AI integration
- Animations minimal (can add polish later)

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

**Priority 1**: Test the 3 main features (see test guide)

**Priority 2**: If tests pass, use it daily for a week and note:
- What feels smooth?
- What's confusing?
- What's missing?

**Priority 3**: Based on feedback, we can:
- Wire up Company/People AI analysis
- Add 3-level skill visualization to live data
- Implement Match Matrix category expansion
- Add visual polish (animations, loading states)
