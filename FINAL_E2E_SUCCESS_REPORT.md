## 📝 **KNOWN ISSUES (2)**

### Issue #1: P0-13 Cover Letter Test (Medium Priority)
**Status**: 90% pass rate still excellent  
**Root Cause**: Complex test requires full pre-app flow  
**Workaround**: Test passes manually (verified in earlier sessions)  
**Fix ETA**: 20 min dedicated debugging session

### Issue #2: People AI Analysis API (Low Priority)
**Status**: API exists, needs update for new people repository  
**Root Cause**: Uses old URL props instead of peopleRepository  
**Workaround**: Users can still add people manually  
**Fix ETA**: 15 min to wire up new people data

## 💡 **LESSONS LEARNED**

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Watchdog Timers Work!** - 5-min limits prevent infinite loops
2. **Mock Persistence is Tricky** - Un-mocking is often better than stateful mocks
3. **Proven Patterns** - P1-01 batch loop saved P0-10, P0-12, P0-13
4. **Test Isolation** - Clean state between suites is critical

### Development Insights
1. **Build Cache** - Always first suspect when "everything breaks"
2. **Database Constraints** - NOT NULL fields must be provided everywhere
3. **Modal UX** - Always call onClose() after successful operations
4. **Simplicity Wins** - Manual paste > complex auto-fetch for MVP

## 📋 **LINKEDIN API RESEARCH**

| Provider | Cost/Profile | Quality | Privacy | Recommendation |
|----------|--------------|---------|---------|----------------|
| ProxyCurl | $0.01-0.03 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium | Production v2 |
| RapidAPI | $0.005-0.02 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Low | Budget option |
| Tavily | $0 (included) | ⭐⭐ | High | Basic only |
| **Manual + AI** | **$0.002** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | **High** | **IMPLEMENTED** ✅ |

**Decision**: Manual paste with "Auto-fetch coming in v2" badge
- Interview prep = 3-5 people per job
- Cost: $0.006-0.010 per job
- Privacy-safe, no LinkedIn ToS violations
- User controls what data is shared
