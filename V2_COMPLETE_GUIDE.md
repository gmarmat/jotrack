# JoTrack v2.0 - Complete Implementation Guide 🚀

## ✅ **All Core Features Implemented**

### **Phase 1-4 Complete: 100%**

---

## 🎯 **What You Can Do Now**

### **1. Delete & Archive System**

#### Delete a Job (5-Day Trash)
1. Go to main page
2. Find any job in the table
3. Click **"Delete"** button (red) → Confirm
4. Job disappears from main list
5. Click **"🗑️ Trash"** button (top-right)
6. See deleted job with countdown: "⏰ Auto-delete in 5 days"
7. Options:
   - **Restore**: Brings job back to main list
   - **Delete Forever**: Permanently removes job + attachments

#### Archive a Job (Permanent Hide)
1. Click **"Archive"** button (yellow) on any job
2. Job disappears from main list (but not deleted)
3. Click **"📁 Archived"** button
4. See all archived jobs
5. Click **"Unarchive"** → job returns to main list

**Key Difference**:
- **Delete**: Temporary (5 days), then auto-purged
- **Archive**: Permanent hide, can unarchive anytime, never auto-deleted

---

### **2. Settings Modal**

### **3. AI Analysis in Right Rail**

#### Access AI Panel
1. Go to any job detail page
2. Look for right rail (collapsed icons on right edge)
3. Click **🤖** robot icon
4. OR press **Ctrl+A** keyboard shortcut
5. AI panel expands with 5 sections

#### AI Sections (All Expanded by Default)
1. **⚡ Quick Insights**
   - Overall match score (0-100)
   - Highlights (strengths)
   - Gaps (improvements needed)
   - Click "Generate Insights" → uses OpenAI

2. **📊 Fit Score Analysis**
   - 25-parameter breakdown table
   - JD Evidence, Resume Evidence, Weight, Score columns
   - Color-coded scores
   - "Explain" toggle for formula
   - Sources at bottom (when using OpenAI)

3. **🔥 Keyword Heatmap**
   - Top keywords from JD vs Resume
   - Frequency bars
   - Match indicators

4. **👥 Company & People Profiles**
   - Company info
   - Recruiter profile
   - Peer profiles
   - (From Coach Mode)

5. **💡 Improvement Suggestions**
   - Coming soon placeholder

#### Refresh Any Section
- Each section has its own refresh button
- Independent loading states
- Provider badge shows Local/Remote

---

### **4. Generate Insights - Real AI**

#### Where to Find It
**Option A: Right Rail AI Panel**
1. Open job detail page
2. Click 🤖 AI tab
3. Expand "Quick Insights"
4. Click "Generate Insights"

**Option B: Timeline (Old Location)**
1. Open job detail page
2. Scroll to timeline
3. Click on "Applied" status
4. Click "Generate Insights" button

#### How It Works
- Automatically checks if you have API key configured
- **Network ON + API key**: Uses OpenAI (real analysis)
- **Network OFF or no key**: Uses dry-run (mock data)
- Extracts JD and Resume from your attachments
- Calls OpenAI with your content
- Shows different results each time

#### Verify It's Working
- Results change on each click (not deterministic)
- Check OpenAI dashboard → token usage increases
- See "AI (Remote)" badge (not "Local (Dry-run)")

## 🎨 **What's Different from v1.x**

### Before (v1.x)
- No way to delete/hide jobs
- Backup/Restore cluttering main page
- AI only in Coach Mode
- "Generate Insights" always dry-run
- AI hard to find (buried in status panels)

### After (v2.0)
- ✅ Delete to trash with auto-purge
- ✅ Archive to hide jobs permanently
- ✅ Settings in clean modal
- ✅ AI accessible from right rail (any status)
- ✅ "Generate Insights" uses real OpenAI
- ✅ All AI features in one unified panel
- ✅ Trash and archived views with restore

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### "Generate Insights" Still Shows Same Results
**Solution**: 
- Verify Network ON in Settings (⚙️ → AI & Privacy)
- Verify API key configured
- Try from AI panel (🤖 tab) instead of timeline

### Token Usage Shows 0
**Reason**: 
- Usage counter only tracks saved AI runs
- Test Connection doesn't save to DB
- Quick Insights uses different API
**Check**: OpenAI dashboard for actual usage

### Delete Button Not Working
**Check**:
- Refresh page (might be cached)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify migration applied: `sqlite3 data/jotrack.db ".schema jobs"`

### AI Panel Empty
**Fix**:
- Click refresh buttons on each section
- Make sure job has JD/Resume attachments
- Check API key is valid (Settings → Test Connection)

---

## 📊 **Performance Notes**

### Token Usage (with gpt-4o-mini)
- **Test Connection**: ~10 tokens (~$0.0001)
- **Quick Insights**: ~500-1500 tokens (~$0.0001-0.0003)
- **Fit Analysis**: ~2000-3000 tokens (~$0.0003-0.0005)
- **Full Coach Mode**: ~5000-8000 tokens (~$0.0008-0.0012)

### Database Performance
- Indexes on `deleted_at`, `archived_at`, `permanent_delete_at`
- Main queries exclude deleted/archived by default
- Trash/archived queries optimized with WHERE clauses
