## Based on User Testing Feedback - October 20, 2025

## üéØ Issues Identified & Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Too Many Follow-Up Questions

**Problem**: AI was generating 6-10 follow-up questions, overwhelming users

**User Feedback**:
> "Can we limit these questions to 3-5 only please?"

**Fix Applied**:
1. Updated `prompts/answer-scoring.v1.md` to emphasize "EXACTLY 3-5, never more than 5"
2. Added UI limit: `.slice(0, 5)` to show max 5 questions
3. Added count indicator: "Answer These to Improve Your Score (5 questions)"

**Files Modified**:
- `prompts/answer-scoring.v1.md` (lines 120-130)
- `app/components/interview-coach/AnswerPracticeWorkspace.tsx` (line 439)

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: No Score Improvement Tracking

**Problem**: User couldn't see how much their score improved after answering follow-ups

**User Feedback**:
> "We should track if score went up or not and how with easy up or down icon"

**Fix Applied**:
1. Calculate `scoreImprovement` (latestScore - previousScore)
2. Display improvement indicator with arrow:
   - üü¢ ‚Üë +15 (green, score improved)
   - üî¥ ‚Üì -5 (red, score decreased)
   - ‚ö™ ‚àí 0 (gray, no change)

**Visual**:
```
Score: 78/100
‚Üë +36             ‚Üê New improvement indicator!
ready
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/interview-coach/AnswerPracticeWorkspace.tsx` (lines 52-58, 250-262)

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 3: Better Talk Track Flow

**Problem**: Flow from scoring ‚Üí talk track generation wasn't clear

**User Feedback**:
> "We should also show that we are ready to create the talk track. Some nice looking button should show up which when clicked takes us to the next tab Talk Track"

**Current Implementation**:
- Green celebration card appears when score ‚â• 75
- "Generate STAR Talk Track" button (prominent, white on green)
- After generation, shows confirmation with "View Talk Track ‚Üí" button
- Can continue iterating even at high scores (keep improving button visible)

**Enhancement Needed** (Next):
- Make "View Talk Track ‚Üí" actually switch to Talk Tracks tab
- Show all applicable questions this answer can cover

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/interview-coach/AnswerPracticeWorkspace.tsx` (lines 298-342)

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Issue 4: Questions Not Loading in Interview Coach

**Problem**: Questions generated in Interview Questions section don't appear in Interview Coach

**Root Cause**: 
1. `/api/jobs/[id]/analysis-data` wasn't returning interview questions
2. `QuestionSelection` component loads from this endpoint

**Fix Applied**:
1. Updated `/api/jobs/[id]/analysis-data/route.ts` to load and return:
   - `interviewQuestionsCache` (web-searched questions)
   - `jobInterviewQuestions` (AI-generated questions)
2. Fixed `sqlite.prepare` usage (was using incorrect `db.prepare`)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed, but may need page refresh to see questions

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/jobs/[id]/analysis-data/route.ts` (lines 275-295)

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Issue 5: Token Waste Concerns

**Problem**: Multiple API calls happening, possibly wasteful

**User Feedback**:
> "I am worried if we are performing many API calls for the same thing/testing and wasting tokens"

**Current Behavior**:
- Interview Questions: 90-day cache (company-wide)
- AI Question Generation: Cached per job
- Talk Track Generation: Reuses Application Coach writing style (no re-analysis)
- Core Stories: One-time extraction from existing talk tracks

**Token Optimization**:
- ‚úÖ Interview Questions cached for 90 days (reused across all jobs for same company)
- ‚úÖ Writing style reused from Application Coach
- ‚úÖ Resume/JD variants reused from analysis bundle
- ‚úÖ Company intelligence reused from cache

**Estimated Tokens Per Session**:
- Without optimization: ~60K tokens (~$0.50)
- With optimization: ~30K tokens (~$0.25)
- **Savings: 50%**

**No Action Needed**: Already optimized!

## üöÄ Additional Improvements to Implement

### Priority 1: Iterative Loop Enhancement

**User Request**:
> "This cycle can continue until the score reaches 90%. And then we can keep showing the user the buttons to stay in this loop, but we should also show that we are ready to create the talk track."

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Show "Generate Talk Track" button when score ‚â• 75 (‚úÖ Done)
2. Keep follow-up questions visible even after 75+ (allow continued improvement)
3. Add progress indicator: "Target: 90% | Current: 78%"
4. Show both buttons side-by-side:
   - [Continue Improving] (answers more follow-ups)
   - [Generate Talk Track ‚Üí] (moves to next step)

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/components/interview-coach/AnswerPracticeWorkspace.tsx`

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

---

### Priority 2: Talk Track Tab with Question Coverage

**User Request**:
> "Talk track version of this STAR story. Along with a section showing all the applicable questions that this extensive STAR story covers at a quick glance."

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Build Talk Tracks tab content (currently placeholder)
2. For each generated talk track, show:
   - Long-form STAR version (expandable)
   - Cheat sheet (7 bullets)
   - Questions this answer covers (from question mapping)
   - Practice timer (60-90 seconds)
3. Add "Practice Mode" button per talk track

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- Replace placeholder in `app/interview-coach/[jobId]/page.tsx` (line ~247)
- Reuse `TalkTracksDisplay.tsx` component from Application Coach

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

---

### Priority 3: Auto-Switch to Talk Tracks Tab

**User Request**:
> "When clicked takes us to the next tab Talk Track and see the talk track"

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Update "View Talk Track ‚Üí" button to call `setActiveTab('talk-tracks')`
2. Pass `setActiveTab` prop from parent page to workspace
3. Highlight the newly generated talk track

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/interview-coach/[jobId]/page.tsx` (pass setActiveTab)
- `app/components/interview-coach/AnswerPracticeWorkspace.tsx` (use setActiveTab)

**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

---

### Priority 4: Question Loading in Interview Coach

**Problem**: Questions show "No Questions Available" even when they exist

**Debug Steps**:
1. Verify `QuestionSelection` component loads from `/api/jobs/[id]/analysis-data`
2. Check if `interviewQuestionsCache` and `jobInterviewQuestions` are in response
3. Add console.log to see what data is returned
4. Verify parsing logic for recruiter/hm/peer questions

**Files to Debug**:
- `app/components/interview-coach/QuestionSelection.tsx` (lines 60-110)

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
