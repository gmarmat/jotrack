### **Adaptive Core Stories**
```
Role Complexity → Story Count:
  ≤ 20: 2 stories (80% coverage)  - Simple IC roles
  ≤ 35: 3 stories (85% coverage)  - Standard PM/Ops roles
  ≤ 55: 4 stories (90% coverage)  - Manager, multi-domain
  > 55: 5 stories (92% coverage)  - Director+, strategic

Formula:
  complexity = responsibilities×2 + domains×5 + level×8 + 
               log(team)×3 + crossFunc×4
```

---

### **Web Search = People Profile Validator!**
```
People Profile: "Samir is data-driven"
     +
Web Search: "Samir OBSESSED with metrics" (5 reports)
     ↓
Confidence: 95% (VALIDATED!) ✅

vs

People Profile: "Tushar is technical"
     +
Web Search: NO mentions of Tushar
     ↓
Confidence: 40% (LinkedIn only, unvalidated) ⚠️
```

**Impact**: 
- User knows which profiles to trust
- Algorithm adjusts based on confidence
- Warnings from web searches incorporated

## 🎬 My Recommendation: **Option A (V1.5 Strategy)**

**Reasoning**:
1. **P0 (V1.1) already done** - Let's validate it works!
2. **V1.5 is high ROI** - 6-8 hours for +17 pts
3. **Skills Gap targeting is CRITICAL** - Can't ship without it
4. **Confidence scoring builds trust** - User needs to know signal quality
5. **V2.0 can wait for feedback** - Don't over-engineer

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ **Test P0 now** (30 min) - Go to Fortive job, test People Profiles
2. ✅ **Implement V1.5** (6-8 hours) - Skills gap + confidence + web intel
3. ✅ **Ship V1.5** - Score: 60/100, usable and valuable
4. ✅ **Plan V2.0** - Based on your feedback from using V1.5
