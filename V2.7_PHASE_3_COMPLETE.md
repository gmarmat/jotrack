## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Upload Phase (Local, FREE):
Resume.docx → Extract text → Save 'raw' variant → DB

Refresh Phase (AI, $0.02):
Read 'raw' → AI extract structured → Save 'ai_optimized' variant
                ↓
           Compare to previous → Changelog
           
Analyze Phase (AI, $0.20):
Read 'ai_optimized' variants → Run all sections → Save results
```

## 🧪 Testing Needed

- [ ] Upload DOCX → See raw extraction log
- [ ] Click "Refresh Data" → See changelog
- [ ] Click "Analyze All" → See success
- [ ] Toggle version → See orange banner
- [ ] Refresh again → See "no changes"

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Mock AI Responses**: Using callAI() which currently returns mock data
   - Will work with real OpenAI/Claude once API key is set
   
2. **All buttons visible**: Currently showing both buttons always
   - TODO: Smart hiding based on `job.analysisState`
   
3. **No real DOCX/PDF parsing yet**: Using mock content in some places
   - Phase 1 extraction works, but needs integration testing

---

## 🔜 Next Steps (Optional)

### Quick Wins:
- Update "Analyze All" to check for variants first
- Smart button visibility (hide/show based on state)
- E2E test with Playwright

### Future (v2.8+):
- Connect to real AI APIs (FitTable, Signals)
- Profile accumulation (Coach Mode)
- LinkedIn profile extraction
