- Production experience (JD emphasizes, resume minimal)

**Bugs to Watch For**:

- Technical: 6-7 questions (Kubernetes, AWS, microservices)
- Projects: 3-4 questions (side projects, open source)
- Achievements: 2-3 questions (quantify impact)

**Bugs to Watch For**:
- Too many/too few questions
- Generic questions (not gap-specific)
- Questions Sarah can't answer
- Poor batching (all at once = overwhelming)

---

#### **Step 6: Answer Discovery Questions - Batch 1** (10 min)
**Questions**: 4 questions (2 leadership, 2 achievements)
**Sarah's Answers** (realistic for junior):
1. **Leadership Q**: "Led a small hackathon team of 3, coordinated tasks"
2. **Leadership Q**: "Helped onboard 2 new interns at current job"
3. **Achievement Q**: "Built feature that improved page load by 30%"
4. **Achievement Q**: Skip (doesn't have major achievements)

- [ ] Progress bar updates (4/18 complete)
- [ ] Can navigate to Next batch

**Bugs to Watch For**:
- Word count incorrect
- Can't skip
- Progress doesn't update
- Stuck on batch (can't proceed)

---

#### **Step 7: Answer Discovery - Batches 2-4** (20 min)
**Batch 2**: 4 technical questions
- Sarah answers 2, skips 2 (doesn't have K8s, AWS experience)

**Batch 3**: 4 project questions

- [ ] Can go back to edit answers
- [ ] Final "Complete Discovery" button appears

**Bugs to Watch For**:
- Answers lost when switching batches
- Can't go back to previous batch
- Progress resets
- Complete button doesn't appear

---

#### **Step 8: Profile Analysis** (20 sec AI call)
**Action**: Click "Complete Discovery"
**Expected**: AI analyzes Sarah's responses

**Expected Extraction**:
```json
{
  "extractedSkills": [
    {"skill": "Team Coordination", "yearsExperience": 1, "source": "Q1"},
    {"skill": "Onboarding/Mentoring", "yearsExperience": 0.5, "source": "Q2"},
    {"skill": "Performance Optimization", "source": "Q3"}
  ],
  "projects": [
    {"title": "Personal Portfolio", "skills": ["React", "Netlify"]},
    {"title": "Hackathon Project", "skills": ["JavaScript", "Team Leadership"]}
  ],
  "achievements": [
    {"achievement": "Improved page load by 30%", "metrics": "30% improvement"}
  ],
  "profileCompleteness": 0.45,
  "gapsFilled": ["Team Leadership (informal)"],
  "remainingGaps": ["Kubernetes", "AWS", "Microservices", "6+ years experience"]
}
```

**Test**:
- [ ] Analysis completes
- [ ] Extracted skills make sense
- [ ] No hallucinated skills (doesn't invent K8s experience!)
- [ ] Source attribution shown
- [ ] Realistic completeness score

**Bugs to Watch For**:
- Hallucinates skills Sarah doesn't have
- Over-estimates experience (says 5 years when has 1)
- Poor source attribution
- Completeness score too optimistic

**Critical**: Profile analysis must be CONSERVATIVE and HONEST!

---

#### **Step 9: Score Recalculation** (15 sec AI call)
**Action**: Auto-advances to Score tab, click "Recalculate Score"
**Expected**: Small improvement only

**Expected Result**:
- Before: 42% (resume only)
- After: 47% (resume + profile)
- Improvement: +5 points

**Test**:
- [ ] Recalculation completes
- [ ] Before/after gauges show correctly
- [ ] Improvement is realistic (not miraculous)
- [ ] Breakdown shows: Resume 42% + Profile 5% = 47%
- [ ] Color still red/orange (still low score)

**Bugs to Watch For**:
- Unrealistic improvement (+20 points)
- Score goes down (algorithm error)
- Gauges display incorrectly
- Wrong color coding (shows green when still low)

**User Psychology**: Sarah should understand:
- ✅ "Profile helped a bit (+5 points)"
- ✅ "But still not qualified for senior role"
- ❌ NOT: "Wow, I'm now qualified!" (false hope)

---

#### **Step 10: Generate Resume** (20 sec AI call)
**Action**: Navigate to Resume tab, click "Generate Resume"
**Expected**: ATS-optimized resume with honest improvements

**Test**:
- [ ] Resume generates
- [ ] Split-view editor loads
- [ ] Left pane: AI-optimized version
- [ ] Right pane: Editable version
- [ ] Resume is truthful (doesn't fabricate experience)
- [ ] Emphasizes transferable skills
- [ ] Includes new achievements from discovery

**Expected Resume Changes**:
- ✓ "Improved page load by 30%" (quantified)
- ✓ "Coordinated hackathon team of 3" (added leadership)
- ✓ "Onboarded 2 new team members" (added from discovery)
- ✗ Does NOT add: "6 years Kubernetes experience" (lying!)

**Bugs to Watch For**:
- Fabricates skills or experience
- Resume is too junior (doesn't use profile data)
- Resume is over-optimized (lies about capabilities)
- Poor keyword integration
- ATS formatting issues

**Critical**: Resume must be HONEST. Better to be truthful than lie for ATS.

---

#### **Step 11: Skip to Recommendations** (Immediate)
**Expected**: After seeing 47% score, Sarah should see recommendations

**Expected Recommendations**:
```json
{
  "verdict": "not_recommended",
  "message": "This role requires 6+ years experience. Consider building skills first.",
  "focusAreas": ["courses", "side-projects", "junior-roles"],
  "courses": [

      "skillsCovered": ["Kubernetes", "Docker", "Microservices", "DevOps"],
      "estimatedTime": "3-4 weekends",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate"
    }
  ],
  "alternativeRoles": [
    "Mid-Level Engineer roles (3-5 years)",
    "Cloud Engineer (entry-level at Fortive)",
    "DevOps Engineer (junior)"
  ]
}
```

**Test**:
- [ ] Recommendations appear
- [ ] Courses are relevant to gaps
- [ ] Projects are achievable
- [ ] Alternative roles suggested
- [ ] Messaging is constructive

**User Psychology**: Sarah should feel:
- ✅ "I have a clear learning path"
- ✅ "I can apply in 6 months after building skills"
- ✅ "Coach Mode saved me from wasting application"
- ❌ NOT: "I'm not good enough" (demotivating)

**Expected Outcome**: Sarah doesn't apply, but has actionable plan
