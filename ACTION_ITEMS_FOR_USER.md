## üìù **ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS**

### Q2: LinkedIn Scraping Options?
**A**: Researched 4 options, chose Manual + AI ($0.002/person) - best for privacy + cost for interview prep use case.

### Q3: Is manual too much work?
**A**: For interview prep (3-5 people), it's acceptable. Auto-fetch can be v2 feature.

### Q4: Need document variants for people?
**A**: NO - profiles are short (200-500 words), no transformation needed. Just cache AI analysis results.

### Q5: Create E2E for AI analysis bugs?
