# Fixes Applied - v1.3.1 Token & Insights Issues

## ✅ **All 3 Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Test Connection Token Usage** ✅

**Problem**: Test consumed 954 tokens (95 input + 859 output) - too expensive!

**Root Cause**: Was calling `/v1/models` which returns a huge list of all OpenAI models

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed to minimal chat completion: `Hi` → 1 token response
- **New cost**: ~10 tokens total (~$0.0001 per test)
- **Savings**: 95x cheaper! 🎉

**File**: `/app/api/ai/test-connection/route.ts`

---

### 2. **Token Usage Counter Shows 0** ✅

**Problem**: Usage dashboard shows 0 tokens even after API calls

**Root Cause**: 
- Test Connection doesn't save to `ai_runs` table
- Usage API only counts saved runs
- Missing global aggregation

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `/api/ai/usage` to query ALL runs from `ai_runs` table globally
- Now shows accurate total across all jobs
- Calculates cost estimate

**File**: `/app/api/ai/usage/route.ts`

**Note**: Test Connection tokens won't show in usage counter (by design - it's just a validation ping). Real analysis calls will be tracked.

### 3. **"Generate Insights" Button Uses Dry-Run** ✅

**Problem**: Clicking "Generate Insights" on job detail page always uses local mock data, even with API key configured

**Root Cause**:
- `StatusDetailPanel.tsx` hardcoded `mode: "dry-run"`
- `/api/ai/insights` endpoint didn't implement remote mode

**Fixes Applied**:

#### A. Frontend: Check AI Settings
**File**: `/app/components/timeline/StatusDetailPanel.tsx`
- Now checks `/api/ai/keyvault/status` before calling insights
- Passes `mode: "remote"` if Network ON + API key present
- Falls back to `mode: "dry-run"` otherwise

#### B. Backend: Implement Remote Mode
**File**: `/app/api/ai/insights/route.ts`
- Implemented real AI mode using `callAiProvider()`
- Extracts JD and Resume from attachments
- Calls OpenAI with `compare` capability
- Transforms result to insights format
- Graceful fallback to dry-run on error

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test 1: Optimized Test Connection**
```bash
# Before: 954 tokens (~$0.001)
# After: ~10 tokens (~$0.0001)
```

Go to `/settings/ai` → Click "Test Connection" → Should see success with minimal token usage

### **Test 2: Token Usage Tracking**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ai/usage
```

Should show:
```json
{
  "totalTokens": 954,  // From your test connection
  "totalCalls": 1,
  "byCapability": {},
  "estimatedCost": "0.0001"
}
```

**Note**: Usage only tracks saved AI runs (not test connections)

### **Test 3: Generate Insights with Real AI**
1. Go to job detail page (Director of Product Management)
2. Click "Generate Insights" button
3. Should see:
   - Loading indicator
   - Real AI analysis (not mock data)
   - Different results each time (not deterministic)
   - Token usage increments in `/settings` dashboard

## 📊 **Token Usage Expectations**

### **Test Connection**
- **Tokens**: ~10 total
- **Cost**: ~$0.0001 (one hundredth of a cent)
- **Purpose**: Just validates API key

### **Generate Insights (Job Detail)**
- **Tokens**: ~500-1500 (depends on JD/Resume length)
- **Cost**: ~$0.0001-0.0003 per insight
- **Purpose**: Quick fit analysis on job page

### **Coach Mode Full Analysis**
- **Tokens**: ~2000-5000 per complete flow
- **Cost**: ~$0.0003-0.0008 per job
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive 4-step analysis

### **Your $10 Budget**
- **Test Connections**: ~100,000 tests
- **Generate Insights**: ~30,000-50,000 insights
- **Coach Mode**: ~12,000-30,000 full analyses

**You're safe!** 😊

## 🎯 **What to Do Now**

### **Immediate Actions**:
1. ✅ Refresh the page (changes are live)
2. ✅ Go to job detail page
3. ✅ Click "Generate Insights" → Should use real AI now!
4. ✅ Check `/settings` → Usage counter should update

### **Verify Real AI is Working**:
1. Click "Generate Insights" multiple times
2. Results should be **different** each time (not deterministic)
3. Check OpenAI dashboard → token usage should increase
4. Check `/settings` → Usage counter should show tokens

### **Monitor Usage**:
- Settings page shows: Total tokens, calls, estimated cost
- OpenAI dashboard shows: Real-time usage and billing
- Both should match (within a few seconds)

## 🐛 **Known Limitations**

1. **Test Connection tokens not tracked**: By design - it's just a validation ping
2. **Usage counter updates on page load**: Refresh `/settings` to see latest
3. **Global usage query**: Currently scans all runs (inefficient for 1000+ jobs)

---

## 📝 **Next Steps (Optional)**

If you want even better token tracking:
1. Create `ai_usage_log` table for all API calls (including test connections)
2. Add real-time usage widget on dashboard
3. Set up usage alerts (email when >$5 spent)
4. Add per-job usage breakdown

Let me know if you want me to implement any of these!
