# Signal Evaluation System - User Guide

## 📊 Understanding Signals

Your resume is evaluated against **up to 60 signals** to determine your match with the job:

### ⚙️ ATS Standard Signals (30 total)
**Icon**: Blue Settings gear ⚙️

These are **30 universal signals** that every ATS (Applicant Tracking System) looks for, regardless of industry:
- ✅ Generic and applicable to any job (marketing, sales, tech, healthcare, etc.)
- ✅ Always evaluated (all 30 signals)
- ✅ Examples: "Required Skills Match", "Years of Experience", "Leadership Experience", "Cultural Fit"

**Categories**:
- Technical Skills & Expertise: 10 signals
- Experience & Background: 10 signals  
- Soft Skills & Culture Fit: 10 signals

### ✨ Dynamic Signals (up to 30)
**Icon**: Purple Sparkles ✨

These are **job-specific signals** generated by AI after analyzing your Job Description:
- ✅ Unique to THIS specific job posting
- ✅ AI generates up to 30 signals based on JD content
- ✅ Examples: "Python Programming", "B2B SaaS Experience", "HIPAA Compliance Knowledge", "Figma Proficiency"

**What AI looks for**:
- Specific technologies, tools, platforms mentioned in JD
- Industry-specific requirements (fintech, healthcare, education)
- Company-stage needs (startup vs enterprise)
- Role-specific competencies

### ⚙️✨ Dual Classification Signals
**Icons**: Both blue gear AND purple sparkles

When an **ATS Standard signal is ALSO heavily emphasized in your JD**, it shows both icons:
- ✅ Tells you: "This is both a universal ATS requirement AND specifically called out in this job"
- ✅ Higher importance - the employer is explicitly looking for this
- ✅ Example: If JD mentions "Strong leadership required" → "Leadership Experience" signal gets ⚙️✨

## 📈 Understanding Scores

- 70-89% = Important requirement
- 50-69% = Mentioned but not critical
- <50% = Minor or not mentioned

### Resume Score

- 90%+ = Strong evidence with specific examples
- 70-89% = Good evidence
- 50-69% = Some evidence but could be stronger
- <50% = Weak or no evidence

### Trend Indicators
- 🔼 **Green Up**: Score improved by >5% since last analysis

## 🎯 Example

```
Category: Technical Skills & Expertise (13 signals)

Expanded view:
⚙️ Required Skills Match        95%    85%    72% 🔼    +6%
   → Universal signal, JD emphasizes it (85%), you demonstrate it okay (72%), improving

⚙️✨ Leadership Experience       75%    90%    80% 🔼    +5%  
   → ATS standard + Called out in JD, both scores high, getting better

✨ Product Analytics Tools       85%    90%    65% 🔽    -3%
   → Job-specific, JD wants it (90%), you're weak (65%), declining - FOCUS HERE

✨ Figma/Sketch Proficiency     60%    70%    45% ↔️    +1%
   → Job-specific, JD mentions it (70%), you show some (45%), stable
```

## ⚖️ Weight Distribution

Each signal has a **base weight** showing its relative importance:
- The weights reflect how much each signal contributes to your overall match score
- Higher weight = more important for the role
- Weights are automatically adjusted based on JD analysis
- Total doesn't need to sum to 100% - think of them as importance multipliers

**How it works**:
- ATS signals start with predetermined weights (e.g., "Required Skills Match" = 95%)
- Dynamic signals get weights based on how often they appear in JD
- Your overall score = (signal weights × your scores) combined across all signals

---

Remember: The goal isn't to score 100% on everything. Focus on:
1. Signals with ⚙️✨ (dual classification) - employer specifically wants these
2. High JD Score but low Resume Score - your biggest gaps
3. Trending down 🔽 - address these before applying
