# Project guardrails
- Always write/update tests (Vitest for units, Playwright for e2e) for every feature.
- Never run long shell commands without summarizing what they do.
- After generating code, run the exact npm script and paste the output.
- Keep DB schema in /db; migrations must be idempotent and scripted.
- Use SQLite FTS5 for search; add test data seeds.
- Definition of Done for any task:
  1) Code + migration + seed
  2) Unit tests passing
  3) Playwright e2e for the user story
  4) Demo steps I (the user) can click through
