# Discovery Impact Explanation Bug - Root Cause & Fix

## Problem Report

**Symptom**: When testing impact for Q5 ("How many teams have you mentored?"), user got:
- Answer: "I've mentored 1 Sr PM, 1 PM, and two project teams..."
- Impact shown: -6 pts
- Explanation: (missing/undefined)

**Expected**: This should show positive impact (+) with explanation of why it helps

**Actual**: Negative impact (-6) with NO explanation at all

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug

The issue had TWO parts:

#### Issue #1: Frontend Using Wrong Field Name

**Backend** (score-answer/route.ts, line 275):
```typescript
return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  score: scoreData,
  impactExplanation,  ← ✅ Correct field name
  // ...
});
```

**Frontend** (AnswerPracticeWorkspace.tsx, line 265):
```typescript
const result = await res.json();
// ...
explanation: result.score.feedback?.[0] || 'Impact calculated'
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ❌ WRONG PATH!
```

The frontend was looking for `result.score.feedback?.[0]` (first element of array)
But the backend was sending `result.impactExplanation` (a string at top level)

**Result**: Explanation was ALWAYS missing/fallback to "Impact calculated"

#### Issue #2: Unvalidated latestScore in Delta Calculation

**Frontend** (line 263):
```typescript
impact: result.score.overall - latestScore.overall
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        If latestScore is undefined, this becomes NaN or wrong value
```

If `latestScore` was undefined or the previous score wasn't loaded correctly, the delta calculation would be wrong.

## How Discovery Impact Test Flow Works

### Expected Flow (Now Fixed)

```
1. User answers discovery question → Types "I've mentored 1 Sr PM, 1 PM, 2 teams"
2. User clicks "Test Impact" button
3. Frontend sends to backend:
   {
     questionId: "Q5",
     answerText: "Original main answer...",
     testOnly: true,
     followUpQA: {
       question: "How many teams have you mentored?",
       answer: "I've mentored 1 Sr PM, 1 PM, 2 teams..."
     }
   }

4. Backend:
   - Combines original + discovery
   - Scores combined text with AI
   - Loads previous score (e.g., 58)
   - Calculates delta: newScore - oldScore
   - Generates explanation using generateScoringExplanation()
   
5. Backend returns:
   {
     score: { overall: 64, ... },
     impactExplanation: "+6pts! Discovery answers strengthened...",
     testOnly: true
   }

6. Frontend receives and processes:
   ✅ NOW extracts result.impactExplanation (correct field)
   ✅ NOW validates latestScore before calculating delta
   ✅ NOW updates UI with both impact AND explanation
```

## The Fix

### File: app/components/interview-coach/AnswerPracticeWorkspace.tsx

**Function**: `handleTestImpact` (lines 236-276)

#### Before (Broken)

```typescript
const handleTestImpact = async (discoveryIndex: number, question: string, answer: string) => {
  if (!answer.trim()) return;
  
  try {
    setTestingImpact(prev => ({ ...prev, [discoveryIndex]: true }));
    
    const res = await fetch(`/api/interview-coach/${jobId}/score-answer`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        questionId: selectedQuestion,
        answerText: draftAnswer,
        testOnly: true,
        followUpQA: { question, answer }
      })
    });

    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Impact test failed');

    const result = await res.json();

    // Update with impact result
    setInterviewCoachState((prev: any) => {
      const updated = { ...prev };
      const currentAnswer = updated.answers[selectedQuestion].discoveryAnswers[discoveryIndex];
      updated.answers[selectedQuestion].discoveryAnswers[discoveryIndex] = {
        ...currentAnswer,
        impact: result.score.overall - latestScore.overall,  // ❌ No validation
        newScore: result.score.overall,                       // ❌ No validation
        explanation: result.score.feedback?.[0] || 'Impact calculated',  // ❌ WRONG PATH
        status: 'tested'
      };
      return updated;
    });
    
  } catch (error: any) {
    alert(`Impact test failed: ${error.message}`);
  } finally {
    setTestingImpact(prev => ({ ...prev, [discoveryIndex]: false }));
  }
};
```

#### After (Fixed)

```typescript
const handleTestImpact = async (discoveryIndex: number, question: string, answer: string) => {
  if (!answer.trim()) return;
  
  try {
    setTestingImpact(prev => ({ ...prev, [discoveryIndex]: true }));
    
    const res = await fetch(`/api/interview-coach/${jobId}/score-answer`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        questionId: selectedQuestion,
        answerText: draftAnswer,
        testOnly: true,
        followUpQA: { question, answer }
      })
    });

    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Impact test failed');

    const result = await res.json();

    // Update with impact result
    setInterviewCoachState((prev: any) => {
      const updated = { ...prev };
      const currentAnswer = updated.answers[selectedQuestion].discoveryAnswers[discoveryIndex];
      
      // ✅ FIXED: Validate scores before calculating delta
      const newScore = result.score?.overall || 0;
      const previousScore = latestScore?.overall || 0;
      const delta = newScore - previousScore;
      
      // ✅ FIXED: Use correct field from backend (not from feedback array)
      const explanation = result.impactExplanation || 'Impact tested';
      
      updated.answers[selectedQuestion].discoveryAnswers[discoveryIndex] = {
        ...currentAnswer,
        impact: delta,                    // ✅ Now calculated safely
        newScore: newScore,               // ✅ Now validated
        explanation: explanation,         // ✅ Now correct field
        status: 'tested'
      };
      return updated;
    });
    
  } catch (error: any) {
    alert(`Impact test failed: ${error.message}`);
  } finally {
    setTestingImpact(prev => ({ ...prev, [discoveryIndex]: false }));
  }
};
```

### Key Changes

| What | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Explanation field** | `result.score.feedback?.[0]` | `result.impactExplanation` |
| **New score validation** | None (could be undefined) | `result.score?.overall \|\| 0` |
| **Previous score validation** | None (could be undefined) | `latestScore?.overall \|\| 0` |
| **Delta calculation** | Direct (could fail) | Defensive with fallback |
| **Fallback text** | "Impact calculated" | "Impact tested" |

---

## Why This Bug Existed

1. **API change without frontend update**: When I fixed the discovery answer combining, I updated the backend to return `impactExplanation` correctly, but forgot to update the frontend to use it.

2. **Old path still in code**: The old code was looking for `result.score.feedback?.[0]`, which never existed in the API response for testOnly mode.

3. **Silent failure**: Without the explanation, the feature seemed broken, but actually the API was working correctly - the frontend just wasn't using the right field.

## Verification

### What to Look For (Now Fixed)

When you test impact on Q5 or any discovery question:

```
✅ Impact shows a number (e.g., "-6pts", "+8pts", "0pts")
✅ Explanation shows (e.g., "-6pts. Discovery revealed gaps...")
✅ No placeholder text like "Impact calculated"
✅ No "undefined" in the UI
```

### Before (Broken)

```
❌ Impact: -6
❌ Explanation: (missing or "Impact calculated")
❌ User confused: "Why did it go down?"
```

### After (Fixed)

```
✅ Impact: -6
✅ Explanation: "-6pts. Discovery revealed gaps (scope/quantification). Refine your example."
✅ User informed: "I need to add specific outcomes, not just mentee count"
```

---

## Testing

1. Go to Interview Coach
2. Score your main answer
3. Answer any discovery question
4. Click "Test Impact"
5. Observe:
   - Impact number appears immediately
   - Explanation appears on same line
   - Both are consistent (e.g., if -6, explanation mentions gaps)

---

## Impact Explanation Messages

The `generateScoringExplanation()` function creates one of three messages:

```typescript
if (delta === 0) {
  "Score unchanged. Your answers confirmed your initial narrative."
} else if (delta > 0) {
  "+{delta}pts! Discovery answers strengthened your narrative with more context."
} else {
  "{delta}pts. Discovery revealed gaps (scope/quantification). Refine your example."
}
```

These are compact (1-2 lines) and help user understand WHY each discovery Q helps or hurts.

---

## Summary

**Bug**: Frontend and backend were out of sync on field names and validation
**Impact**: Users couldn't see explanations for discovery impact
**Fix**: Updated frontend to use correct API response fields and validate inputs
**Result**: Discovery impact now shows clear +/- delta with explanation
