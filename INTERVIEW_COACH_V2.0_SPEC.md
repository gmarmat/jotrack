## 🎯 Persona-Specific Evaluation Framework

### **Universal Evaluation Dimensions (All Personas)**

```typescript
// Every candidate is evaluated across 5 dimensions:
// 1. Experience Relevance (0-100)
// 2. Capability Demonstration (0-100)
// 3. Cultural Alignment (0-100)
// 4. Risk Factors (0-100, higher = lower risk)
// 5. Competitive Position (0-100)

// But WEIGHTS differ per persona:
```

### **Recruiter Weights** (Culture + Risk Focus)
```typescript
{
  experienceRelevance: 15,      // Cares, but not primary
  capabilityDemonstration: 10,  // High-level only
  culturalAlignment: 45,        // PRIMARY FOCUS!
  riskFactors: 25,              // Critical screening
  competitivePosition: 5        // Nice to have
}
```

**Rubric** (100 points):
- Cultural Alignment: 30 pts
- Communication Clarity: 25 pts
- Red Flag Mitigation: 20 pts
- STAR Structure: 15 pts (lower for recruiter)
- Authenticity: 10 pts

**Question Mix** (10 questions):

---

### **Hiring Manager Weights** (Capability + Scope Focus)
```typescript
{
  experienceRelevance: 25,      // Important
  capabilityDemonstration: 45,  // PRIMARY FOCUS!
  culturalAlignment: 15,        // Assumed screened
  riskFactors: 10,              // Less critical
  competitivePosition: 5
}
```

**Rubric** (100 points):
- Impact & Execution: 40 pts (quantified results!)

- 15% Domain expertise
- 10% Gap addressing

---

### **Peer/Panel Weights** (Collaboration + Domain Focus)
```typescript
{
  experienceRelevance: 20,
  capabilityDemonstration: 35,  // Can you do the work?
  culturalAlignment: 30,        // Day-to-day compatibility!
  riskFactors: 5,               // Already screened

```typescript
complexity = 
  responsibilities.length × 2 +
  domainBreadth × 5 +
  roleLevel × 8 +
  log(teamSize) × 3 +
  crossFunctionalTeams × 4

if (complexity ≤ 20): 2 stories (80% coverage)
if (complexity ≤ 35): 3 stories (85% coverage)  ← Standard PM role
if (complexity ≤ 55): 4 stories (90% coverage)
if (complexity > 55): 5 stories (92% coverage)
```

### **Theme Distribution (Persona-Specific)**

**Recruiter** (Focus on fit):

## 🔥 Question Generation Algorithm (15-Signal)

### **Step 1: Strategic Analysis**
```typescript
// Identify showcase opportunities (strong skills)
strongSkills = skillsMatch
  .filter(s => s.matchStrength === 'strong')
  .sort(by importance)
  .slice(0, 5);

// Identify gaps to address (weak critical skills)
criticalGaps = skillsMatch
  .filter(s => s.matchStrength === 'weak' && s.importance === 'critical');

// Identify red flags to pre-empt
redFlags = identifyRedFlags(
  careerTrajectory,    // Job hopping?
  roleLevel,           // Over/under qualified?
  scopeAnalysis,       // Scope gap?
  peopleProfiles       // Interviewer-specific flags?
);

// Identify competitive advantages
advantages = competitiveContext.userAdvantages;
```

### **Step 2: Question Type Distribution (Persona-Based)**
```typescript
if (persona === 'recruiter') {
  questionMix = {
    motivation: 3-4 questions,      // Use: discovery, company intel
    cultureFit: 2-3 questions,      // Use: company culture, work style
    redFlagMitigation: 2 questions, // Use: career trajectory
    backgroundValidation: 1-2 questions, // Use: match score
    logistics: 0-1 questions
  };
}

if (persona === 'hiring-manager') {
  questionMix = {
    starShowcase: 3-4 questions,    // Use: strong skills (70%)
    starGapAddress: 1-2 questions,  // Use: weak skills (30%)
    leadership: 2-3 questions,      // Use: scope analysis
    domainExpertise: 1-2 questions, // Use: domain expertise
    gapAddressing: 1 question       // Use: critical gaps
  };
}

if (persona === 'peer') {
  questionMix = {
    collaboration: 3-4 questions,   // Use: work style, discovery
    problemSolving: 3 questions,    // Use: domain expertise
    domainDepth: 2-3 questions,     // Use: strong skills
    conflictResolution: 1 question  // Use: career trajectory
  };
}
```

### **Step 3: Web Search + AI Generation + Synthesis**
```typescript
// Web search with rich extraction
webIntel = await extractWebIntelligence(company, role, persona);

// Validate People Profiles with web search
if (webIntel.interviewerInsights.some(i => i.name === peopleProfile.name)) {
  peopleProfile.confidence = 95; // Confirmed by web!
  peopleProfile.enhancedWarnings = webIntel.warnings;
}

// Generate AI questions (with all 15 signals)
aiQuestions = await callAiProvider('interview-questions-' + persona, {
  // Tier 1
  companyName, jobTitle, jobDescription, resume, matchScore, skillsMatch,
  companyIntelligence, peopleProfiles, userWritingStyle, discoveryResponses,
  // Tier 2
  companyEcosystem, webSearchIntelligence,
  // Tier 3
  careerTrajectory, roleLevel, scopeAnalysis, domainExpertise, competitiveContext
});

// Synthesize final 4 questions
final4 = selectBest4(
  webIntel.questions,
  aiQuestions,
  criteria: {
    showcaseStrength: 70%,    // Let user shine
    addressGap: 30%,          // Pre-empt concerns
    themeCoverage: 'balanced',
    memorability: 'high'
  }
);
```

---

## 🎯 Answer Scoring Algorithm (Persona-Adaptive)

### **Rubric Selection Logic**
```typescript
function selectRubric(persona, interviewerProfile, roleLevel, scopeAnalysis) {
  // Start with base rubric for persona
  let rubric = BASE_RUBRICS[persona];
  
  // Adjust for interviewer style
  if (interviewerProfile?.communicationStyle === 'Casual') {
    rubric.authenticity += 10;
    rubric.star -= 5;
  }
  if (interviewerProfile?.communicationStyle === 'Data-driven') {
    rubric.quantification += 15;
    rubric.star -= 5;
  }
  
  // Adjust for role level gap
  if (roleLevel.levelJump >= 2) {
    rubric.leadership += 10;  // Must prove readiness
  }
  
  // Adjust for scope gap
  if (scopeAnalysis.readiness === 'significant-stretch') {
    rubric.scope = 20;  // NEW CATEGORY!
  }
  
  // Add penalties for red flags
  if (interviewerProfile?.redFlags?.includes('Lack of metrics')) {
    rubric.penalties.push({
      type: 'no-quantification',
      penalty: -15,
      message: 'CRITICAL: Interviewer requires exact metrics'
    });
  }
  
  return rubric;
}
```

### **Strategic Feedback Generation**
```typescript
function generateStrategicFeedback(score, signals) {
  const feedback = {
    strengths: [],
    gaps: [],
    strategicTips: []  // NEW!
  };
  
  // Add competitive hooks
  if (signals.competitiveContext.userAdvantages.length > 0) {
    feedback.strategicTips.push(
      `💡 Lead with your ${signals.competitiveContext.userAdvantages[0].uniqueSkill} to differentiate`
    );
  }
  
  // Add red flag framing
  signals.redFlags.forEach(flag => {
    feedback.strategicTips.push(
      `⚠️ Address ${flag.type}: Don't say "${flag.dontSay[0]}", say "${flag.doSay[0]}"`
    );
  });
  
  // Add web-validated warnings
  if (signals.webSearchIntelligence.warnings.length > 0) {
    feedback.strategicTips.push(
      `🔥 From ${signals.webSearchIntelligence.warnings.length} candidate reports: ${signals.webSearchIntelligence.warnings[0]}`
    );
  }
  
  return feedback;
}
```

## 🎯 Talk Track Generation Algorithm

### **Style Matching Matrix**
```typescript
const STYLE_ADJUSTMENTS = {
  'Casual and conversational': {
    contractions: true,           // "I'd", "we're"
    sentenceLength: [10, 15],     // words
    emotion: true,                // "I was excited"
    transitions: ['So', 'Basically', 'At the end of the day'],
    vocabulary: 'informal'        // "figured out" vs "determined"
  },
  
  'Formal and data-driven': {
    contractions: false,          // "I would", "we are"
    sentenceLength: [15, 25],
    leadWithMetrics: true,        // First sentence = number
    transitions: ['Subsequently', 'As a result', 'Ultimately'],
    vocabulary: 'business'        // "determined", "achieved"
  },
  
  'Direct and efficient': {
    contractions: false,
    sentenceLength: [8, 12],
    structure: 'RSTA',            // Result first (inverted)
    transitions: [],              // None - just facts
    vocabulary: 'technical'
  }
};
```

### **Content Enhancement**
```typescript
function enhanceTalkTrack(userAnswer, signals) {
  let enhanced = userAnswer;
  
  // Add competitive hook (opening line)
  if (signals.competitiveContext.userAdvantages.length > 0) {
    const hook = `Unlike most ${signals.jobTitle} candidates who come from ${signals.competitiveContext.typicalCandidates.commonCompanies.join('/')}, I bring ${signals.competitiveContext.userAdvantages[0].description}. `;
    enhanced = hook + enhanced;
  }
  
  // Add scope demonstration (if stretch role)
  if (signals.scopeAnalysis.readiness === 'stretch') {
    // Ensure answer mentions team size, budget, users
    if (!enhanced.includes('team') && signals.scopeAnalysis.currentScope.teamSize > 0) {
      enhanced += ` I led a team of ${signals.scopeAnalysis.currentScope.teamSize} people.`;
    }
  }
  
  // Add red flag mitigation (strategic framing)
  signals.redFlags.forEach(flag => {
    if (flag.type === 'short-tenure' && !enhanced.includes('18 months')) {
      enhanced += ` This was at [Company] where I spent 18 months to see the initiative through - my longest tenure because I wanted to complete what I started.`;
    }
  });
  
  // Add interviewer interest reference (if shared experience)
  if (signals.sharedExperiences?.length > 0) {
    enhanced += ` Similar to your experience at ${signals.sharedExperiences[0]}, I found that...`;
  }
  
  return enhanced;
}
```

  - Versatility: 0-10 (how many questions does it cover?)
  - Impact: 0-10 (how impressive is the stat?)
  ↓
Return:
  - Core stories (N stories with one-liners, stats, hooks)
  - Story mapping (question → story + adaptation tips)
  - Coverage report (X/4 questions covered)
  - Metadata (complexity, count reasoning, theme distribution)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria (V2.0)

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] All 15 signals extracted and passed to AI
- [ ] Question generation uses 70/30 showcase/gap strategy
- [ ] Answer scoring uses persona-adaptive rubric
- [ ] Talk tracks match interviewer communication style
- [ ] Core stories count adapts (2-5 based on complexity)
- [ ] Confidence scoring displays per-signal quality
- [ ] Success prediction shows probability + breakdown
- [ ] Web search validates People Profiles
- [ ] Red flag framing guidance appears in feedback
- [ ] Competitive differentiation hooks in talk tracks

### **Quality Requirements**
- [ ] Signal utilization: ≥ 95%
- [ ] Algorithm grade: ≥ 95/100
- [ ] 0 breaking changes
- [ ] Backwards compatible (works without Tier 3 signals)
- [ ] All data persists across refresh

### **User Experience Requirements**
- [ ] Confidence score visible (builds trust)
- [ ] Success prediction actionable (tells user what to improve)
- [ ] Web warnings surfaced ("5 candidates report Samir requires exact metrics")
- [ ] Competitive hooks feel natural (not forced)
- [ ] Red flag framing specific ("Don't say X, say Y")

## 🎯 Testing Strategy (V2.0)

### **Unit Tests** (Vitest)
```typescript
// lib/interview/signalExtraction.test.ts
describe('Career Trajectory Analysis', () => {
  test('detects job hopping', () => {
    const resume = '3 companies in 4 years...';
    const result = analyzeCareerTrajectory(resume);
    expect(result.stabilityScore).toBeLessThan(50);
    expect(result.pivotRisk).toBe('medium');
  });
});

// lib/interview/confidenceScoring.test.ts
describe('Signal Confidence', () => {
  test('validates People Profile with web search', () => {
    const peopleProfile = { name: 'Samir', style: 'Data-driven' };
    const webIntel = { interviewerInsights: [{ name: 'Samir', style: 'data-obsessed' }] };
    const result = calculateConfidence(peopleProfile, webIntel);
    expect(result.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(90);
  });
});
```

### **E2E Tests** (Playwright)
```typescript
test('IC-FULL: Complete V2.0 workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  // 1. Generate questions → Verify 70% target strong skills
  // 2. Draft answer → Verify confidence score displays
  // 3. Score answer → Verify adaptive rubric used
  // 4. Check feedback → Verify web warnings appear
  // 5. Generate talk track → Verify competitive hook included
  // 6. Extract core stories → Verify adaptive count (3 for PM)
  // 7. Check success prediction → Verify probability shows
  // 8. Refresh → Verify all data persists
});
```
