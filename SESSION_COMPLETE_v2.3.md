### Sample Data (No AI Needed):

### Ready But Not In Main UI Yet:
- SkillThreeLevelChart component (created, not integrated)
- Loading shimmer animations (can add if desired)

---

## 🎯 REMAINING WORK (Optional Polish)

### Low Priority (After Your Feedback):
1. 🟡 Add SkillThreeLevelChart to main UI (1 hour)
2. 🟡 Loading animations (shimmer, pulse) (1-2 hours)
3. 🟡 Stale data badges ("Analyzed 2 days ago") (30 min)
4. 🟡 URL Fetch Test button visual feedback (30 min)
5. 🟡 Prompt editor UI in Developer tab (3-4 hours)

**Why Low Priority**: Current features are complete and functional. These are polish items that can be added iteratively.

---

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

### Test NOW (10-15 minutes):
Run all 6 tests above. The new tests (4, 5, 6) are the most important since they're fresh code.

### Expected Results:
- Tests 1-3: Should pass (tested earlier)
- Test 4: **Company Analyze** button should work (new!)
- Test 5: **People Analyze** button should work (new!)
- Test 6: **Expand All** button should work (new!)

### After Testing:
**If All Pass**:
- 🎊 v2.3 is 90% complete!
- Use it for real job applications
- Note any missing features or friction points
- We can add remaining 10% based on your feedback

**If Issues Found**:
- Report which test failed
- What happened vs what you expected
- I'll fix immediately
