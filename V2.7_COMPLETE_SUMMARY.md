## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### Issue 1: Expand/Collapse Not Working
**Problem**: Button didn't work in green "fresh" state  
**Fix**: Changed condition from `isStale &&` to always render when `stalenessInfo` exists  
**Result**: ✅ Works in all 4 states now

### Issue 2: No Quick View Buttons for Analysis
**Problem**: Could only view input documents, not generated insights  
**Fix**: Added "Generated Analysis" section with 3 quick view buttons  
**Result**: ✅ One-click access to all AI-generated content

### Issue 3: No Visual Distinction
**Problem**: Hard to tell inputs from outputs  
**Fix**: Separated sections with clear labels + color-coded gradients  
**Result**: ✅ Clear visual hierarchy

- Verify analysis completeness

### **Quick Navigation**

- One-click to any section
- Smooth scroll animation

### **Visual Clarity**
- Color-coded by type
- Clear input/output separation
- Consistent icon system

### **Always Accessible**

## 📊 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Changed:**
- `app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` - Added collapsible sections + scroll navigation

### **Key Changes:**
1. Removed `!analyzeSuccess &&` condition (panel always shows)
2. Added `dataStatusExpanded` state (collapse/expand)
3. Split into two sections: Input Documents + Generated Analysis
4. Added `id="ai-showcase"` for scroll-to functionality
5. Created gradient backgrounds for analysis types

### **State Logic:**
```typescript
// Shows when:
dataStatusExpanded && attachmentsList.length > 0
  → Input Documents section

dataStatusExpanded && stalenessInfo.hasAnalysis
  → Generated Analysis section
```
