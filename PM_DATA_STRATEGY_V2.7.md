## Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points

1. **Token Waste**: Every AI analysis re-processes the same 2000-token resume, costing $0.015 per section
2. **No Change Detection**: Users don't know when to re-analyze after updating documents
3. **Siloed Data**: Each analysis section extracts insights independently, missing cross-pollination opportunities
4. **Limited Reusability**: Insights from one job application aren't leveraged for future applications
5. **Unclear Analysis Value**: No visibility into what data each analysis consumes or produces

### User Impact

**Quote from user testing**: "I updated my resume and ran analysis again, but I don't know if the system even noticed the changes. Did I just waste money on a duplicate analysis?"

**Measured Issues**:
- 40% of analyses are run on unchanged data (wasted tokens)
- Users upload 3-5 resume versions per job but lack guidance on when to re-analyze
- 0% knowledge transfer between jobs (every job starts from scratch)

## Vision & Strategy

### North Star Metric
**Unit economics that support freemium-to-premium conversion at scale**

### Strategic Pillars

#### 1. Extract Once, Use Many
Transform raw documents into normalized, AI-optimized formats on upload. Reuse these "variants" across all analysis sections.

**Business Impact**: 75% reduction in per-analysis token costs enables aggressive pricing while maintaining margins.

#### 2. Intelligent Staleness Detection  
Automatically detect when analysis results are outdated due to document changes or profile updates.

**User Impact**: Clear guidance on when to re-analyze eliminates guesswork and prevents wasted AI calls.

#### 3. Progressive Profile Building
Accumulate user insights across all job applications, creating a rich global profile that makes each subsequent application better.

**Retention Impact**: Network effects - the more you use JoTrack, the smarter it gets about you.

#### 4. Future-Proof Architecture
Design for single-user now, multi-tenant SaaS later. Zero rewrites needed for monetization.

**Strategic Impact**: Ship fast today, scale tomorrow without technical debt.

## Solution Design

### Core Innovation: Artifact Variants

Every piece of user data (resume, JD, profile) is extracted into 3 variants:

1. **UI Variant** (200 tokens): Lightweight summary for quick display
2. **AI-Optimized Variant** (500 tokens): Structured format for feeding to other AI analyses  
3. **Detailed Variant** (full): Complete extraction for future data mining

**Why This Matters**: Analysis sections use 500-token variants instead of 2000-token raw documents. 75% cost reduction, instant.

### Key User Flows

#### Flow 1: First-Time Job Application
```
1. User creates job, uploads resume + JD
2. System extracts all 3 variants (one-time cost: $0.05)
3. User clicks "Analyze All"
4. All sections reuse variants (cost: $0.02 vs $0.08 without variants)
5. System accumulates generic insights to global profile

ROI: Extraction pays for itself after 2 analyses
```

#### Flow 2: Resume Update & Re-Analysis
```
1. User uploads updated resume v2
2. System detects change via content hash
3. UI shows orange banner: "Major changes detected - re-analysis recommended"
4. User clicks "Re-Analyze"
5. System uses new v2 variants, compares to v1 results
6. UI highlights improvements: "Match score +12% with new resume"

Value: Clear cause-effect feedback loop
```

#### Flow 3: Multi-Job Learning
```
1. User applies to Job A (Software Engineer)
2. During Coach Mode, reveals: "Led team of 5 building Python microservices"
3. System stores in Job A profile + pushes to global profile
4. User applies to Job B (Engineering Manager)
5. System pre-populates leadership examples from Job A insights

Value: Each job makes the next one easier
```
