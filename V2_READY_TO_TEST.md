# JoTrack v2.0 - Ready for Testing! 🎉

## ✅ **What's Been Implemented**

### 1. Delete & Archive System ✅
**Database**:
- Added `deleted_at`, `archived_at`, `permanent_delete_at` columns to jobs table
- Migration applied successfully
- Indexes created for performance

**API Endpoints** (5 new):
- `POST /api/jobs/[id]/delete` - Move to trash (5-day TTL)
- `POST /api/jobs/[id]/archive` - Archive/unarchive
- `POST /api/jobs/[id]/restore` - Restore from trash
- `POST /api/jobs/[id]/purge` - Permanent delete
- `GET /api/jobs/trash` - List deleted jobs with countdown

**UI Features**:
- Delete button on each job row (red)
- Archive button on each job row (yellow)  
- "Trash" button in header → opens trash modal
- Trash modal shows countdown timer ("Auto-delete in X days")
- Restore and "Delete Forever" buttons in trash

### 2. Settings Modal ✅
**Component**: `app/components/SettingsModal.tsx`
- Modal popup with 3 tabs
- **Tab 1**: AI & Privacy (AI settings + link to advanced)
- **Tab 2**: Data Management (Backup/Restore)
- **Tab 3**: Preferences (Stale threshold + future settings)

**Navigation**:
- Settings button (⚙️) in header on main page
- Removed BackupRestorePanel from main page → moved to modal

### 3. AI Analysis in Right Rail ✅
**New Component**: `app/components/ai/UnifiedAiPanel.tsx`
- Consolidated all AI features in one place
- 5 accordion sections (all expanded by default):
  1. ⚡ Quick Insights (score, highlights, gaps)
  2. 📊 Fit Score Analysis (25-parameter breakdown)
  3. 🔥 Keyword Heatmap
  4. 👥 Company & People Profiles
  5. 💡 Improvement Suggestions (placeholder)

**Right Rail**: Updated `app/components/timeline/UtilityRail.tsx`
- Added 4th tab: "🤖 AI" (Ctrl+A)
- Shows UnifiedAiPanel component
- Accessible from ANY status (not just APPLIED)

### 4. Generate Insights Fixed ✅
**Backend**: `app/api/ai/insights/route.ts`
- Implements real AI mode (calls OpenAI)
- Checks network settings automatically
- Extracts JD/Resume from attachments
- Falls back to dry-run on error

**Frontend**: `app/components/timeline/StatusDetailPanel.tsx`
- Checks AI settings before calling API
- Passes correct mode (remote/dry-run)

### 5. Additional Improvements ✅
- Test Connection optimized (95x cheaper: 10 tokens vs 954)
- Token usage tracking fixed (queries all ai_runs globally)
- Rate limiting increased (1000 calls/5min for testing)
- Rate limit reset endpoint added

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### Test 1: Delete & Archive
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. See Delete and Archive buttons on each job
3. Click "Delete" on a job → confirm → job disappears
4. Click "🗑️ Trash" button → see deleted job with countdown
5. Click "Restore" → job reappears in main list
6. Delete again, click "Delete Forever" → permanent deletion

### Test 2: Settings Modal
1. Click ⚙️ icon (top-right)
2. Switch between tabs
3. See AI settings in "AI & Privacy"
4. See Backup/Restore in "Data Management"
5. See Stale Threshold in "Preferences"

### Test 3: AI in Right Rail
1. Go to any job detail page
2. Look for right rail icons (collapsed)
3. Click 🤖 robot icon (or press Ctrl+A)
4. See "AI Analysis" panel with 5 sections
5. Each section is expanded by default
6. Click "Generate Insights" → should use real AI
7. Click refresh buttons → sections update

### Test 4: Generate Insights (Real AI)
1. Go to job detail page
2. Scroll to timeline
3. Click on a status (e.g., "Applied")
4. Click "Generate Insights" button
5. Should see NEW analysis (not same dry-run data)
6. Check OpenAI dashboard → token usage increases

## 📊 **Current Status**

### Completed (Phases 1-4):
- ✅ Database schema with delete/archive columns
- ✅ Delete/restore/purge/archive APIs
- ✅ Settings modal with 3 tabs
- ✅ Trash view with countdown
- ✅ AI panel in right rail with accordions
- ✅ Generate Insights using real OpenAI

### Remaining (Phases 5-6):
- ⏳ Add visualizations (gauges, charts, graphs)
- ⏳ Improve AI panel UX (better loading/error states)
- ⏳ Add archive view (separate from trash)
- ⏳ Write e2e tests
- ⏳ Auto-purge cron job

---

## 🐛 **Known Issues to Watch**

1. **Generate Insights**: May still show dry-run if:
   - Network toggle is OFF
   - No API key configured
   - Job has no JD/Resume attachments

2. **Token Usage**: Counter in settings shows runs from `ai_runs` table
   - Test Connection tokens won't appear
   - Quick Insights tokens won't appear (uses different API)

3. **AI Panel**: First load might be empty
   - Click refresh buttons to generate analysis
   - Requires JD/Resume attachments for best results

---

## 🎯 **What Works Right Now**

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and try:

1. **Settings**: Click ⚙️ → test all 3 tabs
2. **Delete**: Delete a job → view in Trash → restore it
3. **Archive**: Archive a job → should hide from main list
4. **AI Rail**: Open a job → click 🤖 icon → see AI panel
5. **Insights**: Click "Generate Insights" in any section

**All core features are functional!** 🚀

Next steps: Add visualizations and complete the remaining phases.
