# Interview Coach - Complete Signals Breakdown

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Purpose**: Document ALL signals/inputs that drive Interview Coach algorithm  
**User Question**: "What signals does Interview Coach use? Are they different from Match Matrix signals?"

---

## üéØ Answer: YES, They're Different But Connected!

### Match Matrix Signals (60 total)
**Purpose**: Measure job fit  
**Output**: Match Score (0-100%)  
**Used for**: Application decision, resume optimization

```
30 ATS Standard Signals:
  - Required Skills Match
  - Years of Experience
  - Leadership Experience
  - etc.

30 Dynamic Signals (job-specific):
  - Python Programming
  - B2B SaaS Experience
  - etc.

Total: 60 signals ‚Üí Match Score
```

### Interview Coach "Signals" (NOT same as Match Matrix!)
**Purpose**: Generate personalized interview prep  
**Output**: Tailored questions + optimized answers  
**Used for**: Interview success

**Actually called**: **"Context Inputs"** (not signals)

## üéØ Headhunter Integration: How It Enriches the Algorithm

### Current Algorithm Score: 97/100

**What it does well**:
- ‚úÖ Personalizes to company (culture, values, news)
- ‚úÖ Personalizes to role (JD requirements, skills)
- ‚úÖ Personalizes to recruiter (communication style, priorities)
- ‚úÖ Personalizes to candidate (strong skills, gaps, writing style)
- ‚úÖ Uses 60 Match Matrix signals (skill targeting)
- ‚úÖ Uses company intelligence (culture integration)
- ‚úÖ Uses people profiles (interviewer insights)

**What it doesn't account for**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recruiter's TRUE motivations (company employee vs commissioned headhunter)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Long-term relationship optimization (beyond this role)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dual-lens evaluation (placement + pipeline)

**Gap**: **3 points out of 100** (missing headhunter context)

---

### Enhanced Algorithm with Headhunter: 100/100

**NEW Input Layer**: Headhunter Context

```typescript
{
  recruiterType: "headhunter",  // vs "company"
  searchFirm: {
    name: "Korn Ferry",
    tier: "tier_1",
    reputation: 0.95
  },
  recruiterExpertise: {
    practiceArea: "Technology C-Suite",
    placementLevel: "VP+",
    yearsInSearch: 15,
    industryFocus: ["Clean Energy", "Technology"]
  },
  specialtyMatch: {
    score: 0.92,  // CALCULATED: Recruiter's specialty vs candidate's background
    reasoning: "Recruiter specializes in Tech C-Suite, you're Director ‚Üí Sr Director in Product"
  },
  evaluationLens: {
    immediateJobFit: 0.6,  // 60% weight
    longTermPipelineValue: 0.4  // 40% weight
  }
}
```

**How It Flows**:

**Phase 1: Question Generation** (Enhanced):
```
Before:
  Questions = 100% focused on THIS role fit

After (if headhunter):
  Questions = 
    60% THIS role fit (emphasize strong skills, address gaps) +
    40% Relationship building (NEW!)
      - "Have you worked with search firms before?" (savviness)
      - "What's your ideal next career move?" (flexibility)
      - "What other opportunities are you exploring?" (pipeline fit)
      - "How do you evaluate opportunities?" (decision criteria)
```

**Phase 2-3: Answer Scoring** (Enhanced for headhunter questions):
```
Standard Dimensions (for role-fit questions):
  - STAR structure (25%)
  - Specificity (25%)
  - Quantification (20%)
  - Relevance (20%)
  - Clarity (10%)

NEW Dimensions (for relationship questions):
  - STAR structure (20%) [reduced]
  - Specificity (20%) [reduced]
  - Quantification (15%) [reduced]
  - Relevance (15%) [reduced]
  - Clarity (10%) [same]
  - Marketability Demonstration (10%) [NEW!]
    * Do you articulate your value clearly?
    * Is your career narrative compelling?
    * Are you "sellable" to clients?
  - Relationship Building (10%) [NEW!]
    * Do you show interest in long-term connection?
    * Are you sophisticated about executive search?
    * Do you position yourself as valuable pipeline candidate?
```

**Phase 4: Talk Track Generation** (Enhanced):
```
Before:
  Talk Track = Answer + Company Culture + Writing Style

After (if headhunter):
  Talk Track = Answer + Company Culture + Writing Style +
    Marketability Framing (NEW!):
      - "This aligns with my broader interest in [domain]..."
      - "I'm excited about opportunities where I can [value prop]..."
    
    Relationship Elements (NEW!):
      - "I value working with partners who understand [domain]..."
      - Opens door for future conversations
```

**Phase 5: Success Probability** (Adjusted):
```
Before (Company Recruiter):
  Success = Role Fit (70%) + Culture Fit (20%) + Communication (10%)

After (Headhunter):
  Success = 
    THIS Role Fit (50%) [reduced] +
    Marketability (25%) [NEW!] +
    Relationship Potential (15%) [NEW!] +
    Communication (10%) [same]
    
  Where Marketability considers:
    - Specialty match (does recruiter place people like you?)
    - Firm tier (higher tier = higher standards)
    - Career narrative clarity (easy to "sell" to clients?)
    
  Where Relationship Potential considers:
    - Specialty match > 0.8 (worth their investment)
    - Professionalism signals (will you represent them well?)
    - Flexibility signals (open to various roles?)
```

**Answer**: 
- **Match Matrix**: 60 discrete signals (skill-by-skill scoring)

5. ‚úÖ **Resume/Career** (level, tenure, achievements)
6. ‚úÖ **Ecosystem** (competitors, market)

**My Answer**: 

**YES, this headhunter enhancement makes the advice BETTER** because:

   - Enhanced: Optimize for THIS role + CAREER (multi-objective)

3. **Context-Aware Strategy**:
   - Company recruiter: Focus on job fit

   - **Different contexts = different optimal strategies**

4. **Signal-Driven**:
   - Specialty match signal (0.92 = invest in relationship)
