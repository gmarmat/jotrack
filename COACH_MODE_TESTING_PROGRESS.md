## ❌ What's Not Working

### **Bug #11: Score Recalculation Failing** 🟡 P1 - HIGH

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis - Bug #11

**Error**: `Failed to recalculate score` (500 error)

**Investigation Checklist**:
- ✅ Profile exists in database
- ✅ Profile linked to job (job_profile_id set)
- ✅ API endpoint code looks correct
- ❌ Need to check terminal logs for specific error
- ❌ Need to test `getJobAnalysisVariants` function
- ❌ Need to verify AI prompt execution

**Possible Causes**:
1. JD or Resume variant not found
2. AI API error (Claude/OpenAI)
3. JSON parsing error in result
4. Schema mismatch in coach_sessions insert
5. Missing column in database

**Next Debugging Steps**:
1. Check terminal logs for exact error stack trace
2. Test `/api/jobs/[id]/coach/recalculate-score` directly with curl
3. Add detailed console logging to endpoint
4. Test each step individually (load profile, get variants, call AI)
