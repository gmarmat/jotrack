**Status**: PASS  
**Actions**: Answered Q1, Q2, Q4; Skipped Q3  
**Expected**: Word count tracking, auto-save, skip functionality  
**Actual**: All features working perfectly!

**Q1 Answer** (Leadership Initiative):
```
At CloudTech, I led our backend team of 5 engineers through a major system 
redesign. We were facing performance issues with our API taking 800ms per 
request, and I took the initiative to coordinate the team to redesign our 
architecture. I held daily standups, divided work into manageable chunks, and 
personally mentored junior developers on best practices. We reduced response 
time from 800ms to 200ms—a 75% improvement. The system now serves 50,000 
daily users with 99.9% uptime.
```
- ✅ Word count: 77 / 500 words (accurate)
- ✅ Auto-save: "Auto-saved" checkmark appeared
- ✅ Text persisted in field

**Q2 Answer** (Team Coordination):
```
At CloudTech, I coordinated a cross-functional team to resolve a critical 
database performance bottleneck. The problem affected multiple services and 
required input from backend engineers, database admins, and frontend developers. 
I organized daily sync meetings, created a shared Slack channel for rapid 
communication, and built a prioritized backlog. My approach was to break the 
problem into smaller pieces, assign clear ownership, and unblock dependencies 
quickly. We reduced query times from 2-3 seconds to under 100ms, directly 
impacting 50,000 users. The team praised the clear coordination and communication 
structure.
```
- ✅ Word count: 88 / 500 words (accurate)
- ✅ Auto-save: "Auto-saved" checkmark appeared
- ✅ Text persisted in field

**Q3 Skip** (Technical Mentorship):
- ✅ Clicked "Skip" button
- ✅ Text area replaced with "Question skipped." message
- ✅ "Answer instead" button appeared (allows undoing skip)

**Q4 Answer** (Stakeholder Management):
```
At my previous role, I needed buy-in from the DevOps team to adopt a new 
deployment pipeline I designed. They were skeptical because it meant changing 
their established workflow. I scheduled one-on-ones to understand their concerns, 
then created a proof-of-concept that addressed their specific pain points. I 
showed them how it would save them 2 hours per week and reduce deployment 
failures by 60%. By involving them early, listening to their feedback, and 
demonstrating clear benefits, I gained their full support. The new pipeline was 
adopted company-wide within 3 months.
```
