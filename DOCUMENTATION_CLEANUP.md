# Documentation Cleanup Plan - Oct 16, 2024

## üìã Purpose

Clean up internal planning/progress documentation before making repo public. Keep only user-facing documentation.

---

## ‚úÖ **KEEP (Public-Facing Documentation)**

These files provide value to end users and should remain:

```
README.md                   - Main project documentation
CHANGELOG.md                - Version history
ARCHITECTURE.md             - System architecture
UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md         - Component design patterns (NEW!)
TERMINOLOGY_GUIDE.md        - Naming conventions (NEW!)
CURRENT_STATE.md            - Project status (NEW!)
PREVIEW_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md     - Feature documentation
KNOWN_ISSUES.md             - Bug tracking
SIGNAL_LEGEND.md            - Signal system guide
RELEASE_NOTES*.md           - Version release notes
```

**Total to keep**: ~10 files

... (50+ more files)
```

**Estimated count**: 50-60 files

---

## üßπ **Cleanup Strategy**

### Phase 1: Create Backup (Safety)
```bash
# Create backup before deletion
tar -czf docs_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz *.md
mv docs_backup_*.tar.gz ~/Downloads/
```

### Phase 2: Remove Planning Docs
```bash
# Remove files matching patterns (safe, one by one)
rm -f *_PLAN.md
rm -f *_COMPLETE.md
rm -f *_STATUS.md
# ... etc
```

### Phase 3: Verify
```bash
# List remaining .md files
ls -1 *.md

# Should only see ~10 public-facing docs
```

### Phase 4: Update README
```bash
# Update README.md with current state
# Remove outdated setup instructions
# Add links to new docs (UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM, etc.)
```

---

## üìä **Before & After**

### Before Cleanup
```
Total .md files: ~60
Public docs: ~10
Planning docs: ~50
Ratio: 17% public, 83% clutter
```

### After Cleanup
```
Total .md files: ~10
Public docs: ~10
Planning docs: 0
Ratio: 100% public, 0% clutter
```

## üö® **Important Notes**

1. **Create backup first!** Don't delete without safety net.
2. **Review each file** before deleting (some might have valuable notes).
3. **Update README** to reflect current state.
4. **Git history cleanup** needed later (BFG Repo-Cleaner).
5. **This cleanup doc itself** should be removed before public!

---

**Status**: Planning phase  
**Execution**: Pending user approval  
**Risk**: Low (backup created first)
