# 🚀 Coach Mode v1.1 - START HERE

## ✅ BUILD: SUCCESS
## 🌐 DEV SERVER: STARTING...

The dev server is now starting in the background. It should be ready in ~10 seconds.

---

## 📍 WHAT TO DO NOW

### 1. Wait for Server (10 seconds)
The server is starting up. You should see it on:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Open Your Browser
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**

You should see the Jotrack dashboard with your jobs.

### 3. Test Coach Mode v1.1 (3 minutes)

**Create a Job** (if you don't have one):
1. Fill in "Add New Job Application" form
   - Title: "Test Engineer"
   - Company: "Test Corp"  
   - Status: "APPLIED"
2. Click "Add Job Application"

**Enter Coach Mode**:
1. Note the job ID from the URL or table
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/coach/[jobId]`
   (replace [jobId] with actual ID, e.g., `/coach/abc123`)

**Test No Hallucination** (CRITICAL):
1. Fill JD textbox with:
   ```
   Python Django developer needed
   PostgreSQL and AWS required
   ```

2. Fill Resume textbox with:
   ```
   Python Django expert
   PostgreSQL database design
   AWS cloud infrastructure
   ```

3. Click "Analyze →"
4. Click "Next →" on Profile step (wait ~2 sec)
5. On Fit step, look at the table

**VERIFY (CRITICAL)**:
- ✅ "Python" appears in fit table
- ✅ "Django" appears
- ✅ "PostgreSQL" appears
- ✅ "AWS" appears  
- ❌ "React" does NOT appear
- ❌ "TypeScript" does NOT appear
- ❌ "Node.js" does NOT appear

6. Click "Explain: How we calculated this"
   - ✅ Formula shows: `Overall FIT = Σ(weight_i × score_i)`
   - ✅ Top 3 contributors listed

**If all verified**: ✅ v1.1 is working perfectly!

## 🐛 IF UI LOOKS BROKEN

### Symptom: No styles, plain text only

**Cause**: Tailwind CSS might not be compiling

**Fix**:
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear Next.js cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```
3. Restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### Symptom: Components not rendering

**Check Browser Console** (F12):
- Look for red errors
- Common issues:
  - Import errors
  - Missing components
  - Type mismatches

**Most Likely**: The dev server is still warming up. Wait 10-15 seconds after starting.

---

## 🧪 RUN TESTS AFTER MANUAL VERIFICATION

Once manual test passes, run automated tests:

```bash
# Critical test
npm run e2e -- no-hallucination.spec.ts --reporter=line

# All v1.1 tests  
npm run e2e -- gather-intake fit-evidence no-hallucination citations --reporter=line
```

---

## 📊 BUILD STATUS

✅ TypeScript: Clean (Set iteration fixed)
✅ Build: Success (prerender warning is normal)  
✅ Files: All 11 new files created
✅ Server: Starting...

**Prerender Error Explained**:
The `/page` warning is expected because Next.js tries to statically generate pages at build time, but your home page uses database connections which only work at runtime. This is NORMAL and doesn't affect the app functionality. The build still succeeded.

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

v1.1 is DONE when you verify:

- [ ] Server runs (http://localhost:3000 loads)
- [ ] Dashboard looks normal with CSS styles
- [ ] Coach mode loads (/coach/[jobId])
- [ ] No hallucinations (React absent when not in sources)
- [ ] Explain accordion works
- [ ] E2E tests pass

**Current**: Server starting... check http://localhost:3000 now!

---

## 🆘 IF PROBLEMS

1. **Server won't start**: 
   - Check if port 3000 is in use: `lsof -i :3000`
   - Kill and restart

2. **UI broken**:
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R
   - Clear cache: rm -rf .next && npm run dev

3. **Tests failing**:
   - See `BUILD_AND_TEST_VERIFICATION.md` for troubleshooting
