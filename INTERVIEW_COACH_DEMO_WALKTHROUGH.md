### **Part 11: Explore Story Details** (4 minutes)

**Actions**:
1. Click on **Story 1: "Microservices Migration"** card
2. Card expands to show full details

**Show**:

**Full STAR Breakdown**:

**Situation**:
> "At BigTech Corp, our monolith architecture was causing deployment bottlenecks, taking 4 hours per release and limiting our ability to scale beyond 10K users. The business needed to move faster and handle 50K users."

**Task**:
> "I was tasked with leading the migration to microservices to enable faster iteration and horizontal scaling. As tech lead, I was responsible for the architecture and team of 6 engineers."

**Action**:
> "I architected the microservices design using domain-driven design principles, breaking the monolith into 8 services. We used Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. The biggest challenge was maintaining zero-downtime during migration, which I solved with feature flags and blue-green deployments. I also conducted weekly architecture reviews and mentored 2 junior engineers."

**Result**:
> "We reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 30 minutes (87% improvement), cut infrastructure costs by $200K annually through better resource utilization, and successfully scaled to 50K concurrent users. Our team velocity increased 3x - shipping features weekly instead of monthly. Two junior engineers on my team were promoted to mid-level roles."

**Cheat Sheet** (Memorization Aid):
- Context: Monolith → 4hr deploys, 10K user limit
- Role: Tech lead, 6 engineers, 4 months
- Tech: Docker, Kubernetes, 8 microservices
- Challenge: Zero-downtime migration
- Solution: Feature flags, blue-green deployments
- Results: 4hr → 30min (87%), $200K saved, 3x velocity
- Impact: 10K → 50K users, 2 juniors promoted

**Questions This Story Answers**:

1. **"Tell me about system design experience"**
   - Opening: "Great question. At BigTech Corp, we faced a critical architecture decision..."
   - Emphasis: Docker + K8s choice, 8 service boundaries, zero-downtime migration
   - Time: ~90 seconds

2. **"Most technically challenging problem"**
   - Opening: "The migration to microservices was incredibly challenging..."
   - Emphasis: Zero-downtime requirement, feature flags strategy
   - Time: ~80 seconds

3. **"Describe architecture decision"**
   - Opening: "At BigTech Corp, we had to decide between staying monolith or going microservices..."
   - Emphasis: Tradeoffs (consistency vs speed), DDD principles
   - Time: ~90 seconds

...(and 2 more questions)

**Talking Points**:

> "See how ONE story answers 5 different questions? The key is in the adaptation."
>
> "For system design questions, I emphasize the architecture decisions and technical depth."
>
> "For challenge questions, I emphasize the zero-downtime requirement and how I solved it."
>
> "Same story, different framing. This is how you prepare efficiently!"
>
> "The cheat sheet is what you memorize. 7 bullet points - that's it! Much easier than memorizing 5 full answers."

---

### **Part 12: Practice & Memorization Tools** (2 minutes)

**Tab**: Final Prep (currently placeholder, show what's coming)

**Talking Points**:

> "Once you have your core stories, Final Prep provides tools to master them:"
>
> **Features** (Coming Soon):

### **Part 13: Data Architecture Deep Dive** (3 minutes)

**Screen**: Switch to database viewer or show architecture diagram

**Show**:

**Database Schema**:
```sql
coach_state
├── job_id (PK)
├── data_json              -- Application Coach data
├── interview_coach_json   -- Interview Coach data (NEW!)
└── updated_at

Structure of interview_coach_json:
{
  "selectedQuestions": [...],
  "answers": {
    "q1": {
      "iterations": [...],  -- All drafts preserved
      "scores": [...],      -- All scores preserved
      "talkTrack": {...}
    }
  },
  "coreStories": [...],
  "storyMapping": {...},
  "progress": {...}
}
```

**Talking Points**:

> "Interview Coach uses a separate JSON field in the same `coach_state` table. This keeps Application Coach and Interview Coach data completely isolated."
>
> "All iterations are preserved in arrays - we NEVER overwrite. You can review your entire improvement journey."
>
> "Interview Coach reuses data from Application Coach (writing style, discovery responses) and job analysis (JD, resume, company intel). Zero token waste!"

**Token Savings Example**:
- Without reuse: ~30K tokens per interview prep
- With reuse: ~15K tokens per interview prep
- **Savings: 50%!**

---

### **Part 14: Integration with Application Coach** (2 minutes)

**Show**:

**Data Flow Diagram**:
```
Application Coach (Pre-Application)
├── Discovery Wizard → Writing Style Profile ────┐
├── Resume Analysis → Resume Variants ───────────┼─→ Reused by Interview Coach
├── Company Intelligence → Culture Data ─────────┤
└── Match Score → Gap Analysis ──────────────────┘

Interview Coach (Post-Application)
├── Reads: Writing Style (for talk tracks)
├── Reads: Resume + JD (for scoring context)
├── Reads: Company Intel (for cultural fit)
└── Generates: Scores, Talk Tracks, Core Stories
```

**Talking Points**:

> "Interview Coach and Application Coach work together but remain independent."
>
> "Application Coach focuses on: Getting the interview (resume optimization, score improvement)"
>
> "Interview Coach focuses on: Acing the interview (answer preparation, core stories)"
>
> "They share data but don't interfere. You can go back to Application Coach to update your resume, and Interview Coach will automatically pick up the new version."

---

## 🎯 Demo Summary & Q&A

### Key Takeaways

1. **Efficiency**: 2-3 stories vs 50 individual answers
2. **AI-Guided**: Specific feedback, not generic tips
3. **Iterative**: Score → Improve → Re-score → Track
4. **Data Reuse**: Leverages Application Coach data (50% token savings)
5. **Separate Concerns**: Interview Coach ≠ Application Coach

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: How long does interview prep take with Interview Coach?**  
A: Typically 2-4 hours to complete 8-10 questions, generate talk tracks, and extract core stories. Compare to traditional prep (10-20 hours of memorizing individual answers).

**Q: What if I don't have Application Coach data?**  
A: Interview Coach works standalone! It just won't have writing style context for talk tracks. You can still use scoring and core stories extraction.

**Q: Can I use this for multiple interview rounds?**  
A: Yes! That's why we have 3 persona buttons. Prepare separately for Recruiter, Hiring Manager, and Peer interviews. Each builds on the previous.

**Q: What happens if my core stories don't cover all questions?**  
A: The AI will tell you coverage percentage. If it's < 80%, it recommends adding 1 more diverse question to improve coverage.

**Q: Does this work for non-technical roles?**  
A: Absolutely! The STAR rubric and core stories strategy work for any role - sales, marketing, product management, etc.
