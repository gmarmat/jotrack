## 🎯 Overview

### The Philosophy

**Traditional ATS Systems**:
- Use ~10-15 generic signals (years of experience, education, keywords)
- One-size-fits-all approach
- Miss nuanced requirements
- Can't adapt to industry/role specifics

**Our Approach**:
- **60 signals total**: 30 ATS Standard + up to 30 Dynamic
- **Industry-agnostic ATS signals**: Work for ANY role (PM, Engineer, Sales, Marketing, Healthcare)
- **Role-specific Dynamic signals**: Generated by AI from actual JD
- **Dual classification**: When ATS signal is emphasized in JD → Extra important!
- **Weighted scoring**: Not all signals are equal

### The Innovation

**Most ATS systems ask**: "Does resume contain keyword X?"

**We ask**: 
1. "Is X mentioned in JD?" (JD Score)
2. "Is X demonstrated in Resume?" (Resume Score)
3. "How important is X for THIS specific role?" (Weight)
4. "Is X both a universal requirement AND specifically called out?" (Dual classification)

Result: **Context-aware, role-specific matching** instead of blind keyword search

### Why 60 Signals?

**Research-Based Optimum**:
- < 30 signals: Too generic, misses nuances
- 60 signals: Sweet spot (granular but manageable)
- > 100 signals: Diminishing returns, redundancy

**Coverage**:
- Technical skills: 18 signals (30%)
- Experience: 17 signals (28%)
- Soft skills: 15 signals (25%)
- Role-specific: 10 signals (17%)

### Weight Calculation

**Base Weight** (0-1 scale):
- Assigned to each signal based on general importance
- Higher weight = More critical for success

**Dynamic Weight** (0-1 scale):
- Adjusted based on JD analysis
- If JD emphasizes signal → Weight increases
- If JD doesn't mention → Weight decreases

**Final Weight** (used in scoring):
```
Final Weight = Base Weight × JD Emphasis Factor × Category Weight

Where:
- Base Weight: 0.55 to 0.95 (predefined per signal)
- JD Emphasis Factor: 0.5 to 2.0 (AI-determined)
- Category Weight: 30%, 35%, or 35% (Technical, Experience, Soft)

Example:
Signal: "Python Programming" (Dynamic signal)
Base Weight: 0.85
JD Emphasis: 1.8 (mentioned 4 times in JD)
Category: Technical (30%)

Final Weight = 0.85 × 1.8 × 0.30 = 0.459 (46% of total score)
```

## 🤖 Dynamic Signal Generation

### AI Prompt for Signal Generation

```markdown
## Task: Generate Dynamic Signals

Analyze the Job Description below and generate **up to 30 role-specific signals**.

### Job Description
{{jdText}}

### Instructions

1. **Extract Specific Requirements**:
   - Technologies, tools, platforms mentioned
   - Programming languages, frameworks
   - Certifications, licenses required
   - Industry-specific requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, FDA compliance)

2. **Identify Company-Specific Needs**:
   - Company stage (startup vs enterprise)
   - Work environment (remote, hybrid, office)
   - Team structure (size, reporting, cross-functional)

3. **Detect Role-Specific Competencies**:
   - If PM: Roadmap, stakeholder management, user research
   - If Engineer: System design, code quality, testing
   - If Designer: Design systems, prototyping, user testing
   - If Sales: Pipeline management, CRM, quota achievement

4. **Generate 20-30 Signals**:
   Each signal should have:
   - `name`: Descriptive name (e.g., "Python Programming")
   - `category`: 'technical', 'experience', or 'soft'
   - `description`: What this signal measures
   - `baseWeight`: 0.55 to 0.95 based on importance
   - `searchKeywords`: List of keywords to search for in resume

5. **Avoid Duplicates**:
   Don't create signals that overlap with ATS Standard signals.
   Example: Don't create "Years of Experience" (already in ATS)

### Output Format

## 📈 Signal Evaluation Algorithm

### For Each Signal

```
1. EXTRACT JD EVIDENCE
   - Search for signal keywords in JD
   - Count mentions
   - Identify context (required, preferred, nice-to-have)
   - Extract direct quotes

2. CALCULATE JD SCORE (0-100)
   Score = MIN(100, mentions × 20 + contextMultiplier)
   
   Where contextMultiplier:
   - "Required/Must have": +30
   - "Preferred/Should have": +15
   - "Nice to have/Plus": +5
   - Not mentioned: 0

3. EXTRACT RESUME EVIDENCE
   - Search for signal keywords in resume
   - Count mentions
   - Identify context (job titles, achievements, skills section)
   - Extract direct quotes
   - Calculate years of experience (if applicable)

4. CALCULATE RESUME SCORE (0-100)
   Score = MIN(100, mentions × 15 + experienceYears × 5 + achievementBonus)
   
   Where:
   - mentions: # of times keyword appears
   - experienceYears: Years worked with this skill (0-10)
   - achievementBonus: +20 if quantified achievement exists

5. CALCULATE OVERALL SCORE (0-100)
   Overall = (JD Score × 0.4) + (Resume Score × 0.6)
   
   Rationale: Resume demonstration (60%) more important than JD mention (40%)

6. GENERATE AI REASONING
   Prompt: "Based on JD evidence: '{{jdEvidence}}' and Resume evidence: '{{resumeEvidence}}',
            explain why this signal scored {{overallScore}}/100. Be specific and actionable."

7. SAVE EVALUATION
   Store: signalId, jdScore, resumeScore, overallScore, jdEvidence, resumeEvidence, aiReasoning
```

### Example Evaluation

**Signal**: "Python Programming" (Dynamic)

**JD Evidence**:
```
"5+ years of Python experience required"
"Experience with Django or Flask frameworks"
"Python used for backend API development"
```
- Mentions: 3
- Context: "Required" (+30)
- **JD Score**: MIN(100, 3×20 + 30) = 90

**Resume Evidence**:
```
"Senior Backend Engineer (2020-2024): Built APIs using Python/Django"
"Backend Engineer (2018-2020): Developed microservices in Python"
Skills: Python, Django, Flask, FastAPI
```
- Mentions: 4
- Experience Years: 6 (2018-2024)
- Achievement: "Reduced API latency by 60% using Python optimization"
- **Resume Score**: MIN(100, 4×15 + 6×5 + 20) = 110 → 100

**Overall Score**: (90 × 0.4) + (100 × 0.6) = **96/100**

**AI Reasoning**:
"Strong match. Resume demonstrates 6+ years of Python experience exceeding the required 5+ years. Multiple mentions of Django framework align with JD requirements. Quantified achievement (60% latency reduction) shows technical depth beyond keyword matching."

---

## 🎯 Match Score Calculation

### Weighted Average Across All Signals

```
Match Score = Σ(Signal Score × Signal Weight) / Σ(Signal Weights)

Where:
- Signal Score: 0-100 (from evaluation)
- Signal Weight: Final weight (base × emphasis × category)
```

### Step-by-Step Example

**Assume 60 signals evaluated (30 ATS + 30 Dynamic)**

**Category Scores**:
```
Technical Skills (30%)
- 18 signals evaluated
- Average score: 78/100
- Weighted contribution: 78 × 0.30 = 23.4

Experience & Background (35%)
- 17 signals evaluated
- Average score: 72/100
- Weighted contribution: 72 × 0.35 = 25.2

Soft Skills & Culture Fit (35%)
- 15 signals evaluated
- Average score: 68/100
- Weighted contribution: 68 × 0.35 = 23.8

Total Match Score: 23.4 + 25.2 + 23.8 = 72.4/100 ≈ 72%
```

### Score Interpretation

```
85-100: Excellent Match (Top 10% of applicants)
        → Immediate interview, high priority

75-84:  Strong Match (Top 25%)
        → Strong interview candidate

60-74:  Good Match (Top 50%)
        → Interview if resume improvements made

45-59:  Fair Match (Below average)
        → Significant gaps, major improvements needed

0-44:   Poor Match (Bottom 25%)
        → Not recommended for this role
```

### Example Integration

**Scenario**: User has Python score of 45/100 in Coach Mode

**In Interview Coach**:

**Question Generated** (targeting weak signal):
"Can you walk me through a time you used Python to solve a technical challenge?"

**User's Draft Answer**:
"I used Python to build an API..."

**AI Scoring** (knows Python is weak signal):
- Overall: 65/100
- Feedback: "Good start, but need more depth since your resume shows limited Python experience."
- Follow-up Questions:
  1. "How many years have you worked with Python?"
  2. "What frameworks did you use (Django, Flask, FastAPI)?"
  3. "What was the scale? (requests/day, users, data volume)"
  4. "What was the measurable impact?"

**User Provides Follow-ups**:
1. "5 years (2018-2023)"
2. "Django for REST API, used DRF"
3. "1M requests/day, 10K active users"
4. "Reduced API latency 60%, improved UX scores"

**AI Re-scores**:
- Overall: 88/100
- New Feedback: "Excellent! You've now provided the depth needed. This answer showcases strong Python experience despite resume gaps."
- **Bonus**: "Consider updating your resume's Python section with these details!"

-- ATS Standard Signals (seeded once)
CREATE TABLE ats_signals (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'technical', 'experience', 'soft'
  description TEXT,
  base_weight REAL NOT NULL, -- 0-1
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Dynamic Signals (generated per job)
CREATE TABLE job_dynamic_signals (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  job_id TEXT NOT NULL,
