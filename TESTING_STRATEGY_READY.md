---

## ✅ What's Ready

### 1. Comprehensive Test Strategy (V2)
**Files**:
- `E2E_TESTING_STRATEGY_V1.md` - Initial plan (78/100)
- `E2E_TESTING_STRATEGY_V2_FINAL.md` - Improved plan (95/100)

**Coverage**:
- ✅ 5 staleness states tested
- ✅ 5 downstream sections integration tested
- ✅ 10+ edge cases covered
- ✅ Information fidelity verification
- ✅ Token optimization verification
- ✅ Performance & concurrency tests

### 2. Golden Dataset Generator
**File**: `scripts/generate-golden-dataset.mjs`

**What It Does**:
1. Creates test job
2. Uploads test-resume.txt
3. Calls REAL AI to create optimized variant
4. Saves AI output as fixture
5. Verifies quality
6. Creates metadata.json
7. Cleans up test data

**Cost**: ~$0.01 (one AI call)  
**Reuse**: Forever (all future test runs use saved output)

### 3. Test Fixtures
**Files**:
- `e2e/fixtures/data-pipeline/test-resume.txt` (351 words) ✅
- `e2e/fixtures/data-pipeline/test-jd.txt` (542 words) ✅
- Validated with all required terms ✅

### 4. Test Suite Structure

## 🎯 How to Execute

### Option 1: Generate Golden Dataset (One-Time Setup)

**If you want to create the golden dataset** (makes real AI calls):

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure server is running
npm run dev

# Step 2: Generate golden dataset (REAL AI, ~$0.01)
node scripts/generate-golden-dataset.mjs --confirm

# Expected output:
# ✅ AI-Optimized variant retrieved: 287 words
# 💾 Saved to golden-dataset/outputs/
# 🎉 GOLDEN DATASET GENERATED!
```

**Result**:
- `e2e/fixtures/golden-dataset/outputs/resume-standard-ai-optimized.txt`
- `e2e/fixtures/golden-dataset/metadata.json`
- All future tests use this (cost: $0.00)

### Option 2: Manual Testing (No Code, Just Browser)

**Quick 5-minute manual test**:

```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Create new job: "E2E Test Job"
3. Upload: e2e/fixtures/data-pipeline/test-resume.txt
4. Check Attachments modal:
   → Should see green "ACTIVE" badge on v1 ✓
5. Click "Refresh Data" in Data Pipeline column
6. Watch terminal logs:
   📎 Found 1 active attachments:
      - resume: test-resume.txt (v1, isActive=1)
   🔄 Creating AI-optimized variant...
   ✅ AI-Optimized: 287 words (from 351 raw) - Cost: $0.0098
   ✅ Variant refresh complete. Total cost: $0.010
7. Open variant viewer (eye icon)
8. Check: AI-Optimized column shows clean text ✓
9. Check: Detailed column says "Not created - Using 2-variant system" ✓
```

**What to Verify**:
- ✅ Cost is ~$0.01 (not $0.02)
- ✅ AI-optimized shows readable text
- ✅ Green ACTIVE badge visible
- ✅ Terminal shows which files extracted

### Option 3: Automated Test Suite (Future)

**Write and run full test suite**:

```bash
# Unit tests (mocked, free)
npm run test -- tests/unit/

# Integration tests (mocked, free)
npm run test -- tests/integration/

# E2E tests (real AI, ~$0.05)
npm run test:e2e -- e2e/data-pipeline.spec.ts
```

**Note**: Test files not yet written (would need another 1-2 hours)

## 🐛 Expected Issues to Find

Based on the strategy, we'll likely discover:

**Category 1: Information Fidelity (High Priority)**
- [ ] AI-optimized missing some skills
- [ ] AI-optimized hallucinating achievements
- [ ] Numbers changed (8 years → 8+ years - acceptable?)
- [ ] Abbreviations expanded incorrectly (AWS → Amazon Web Services when it's Amazon Workspace)

**Category 2: Staleness Detection (Medium Priority)**
- [ ] False positives (minor typo triggers "major change")
- [ ] False negatives (actual change not detected)
- [ ] Race condition (upload + extract simultaneously)
- [ ] Trigger doesn't fire on version switch

**Category 3: Integration Issues (High Priority)**
- [ ] Match Score can't parse new variant format
- [ ] Company Intel expects old JSON structure
- [ ] Skills Match breaks with text-only variant
- [ ] Interview Coach doesn't extract skills correctly

**Category 4: UX Issues (Medium Priority)**
- [ ] Variant viewer shows JSON instead of text
- [ ] Active badge not visible in dark mode
- [ ] Cost estimate incorrect
- [ ] Loading states missing

**Category 5: Performance (Low Priority)**
- [ ] Large documents timeout
- [ ] Concurrent requests create duplicates
- [ ] Memory leak after many extractions

**Estimated**: 10-15 bugs total  
**Severity**: 3-5 critical, 5-8 medium, 2-4 minor

### View Variants
- [ ] Click eye icon to open variant viewer
- [ ] "Raw Text" column shows original extracted text
- [ ] "AI-Optimized" column shows clean, formatted text
- [ ] Detailed column says "Not created - Using 2-variant system"
- [ ] Footer explains 2-variant system benefits

### Staleness Detection
- [ ] After extraction: Shows "AI data ready - click Analyze All"
- [ ] After "Analyze All": Shows "Analysis is up to date"
- [ ] Upload v2: Shows "Key documents changed - re-analysis recommended"
- [ ] Upload identical v2: Stays "fresh" (content hash unchanged)

### Information Fidelity
- [ ] AI-optimized contains all key facts:
  - [ ] Name: John Doe
  - [ ] Email: john.doe@example.com
  - [ ] Years: 8+ years
  - [ ] Skills: Python, Django, AWS
  - [ ] Companies: Tech Company A, Tech Company B
  - [ ] Education: BS Computer Science
- [ ] AI-optimized has NO hallucinations (no extra companies, skills, achievements)
- [ ] Formatting improved (no "Page 1", excessive whitespace, etc.)

### Token Efficiency
- [ ] Raw: ~350 words = ~1400 tokens
- [ ] AI-Optimized: ~280 words = ~1120 tokens
- [ ] Reduction: ~20-30% (acceptable for quality preservation)
