# P0 Test Regression - Investigation Plan v2.0 (IMPROVED)
**Date**: October 18, 2025, 10:35 PM  
**Situation**: P0 tests: 85% ‚Üí 75% (4 new failures)  
**Objective**: Systematic root cause analysis + fix WITHOUT breaking ui-polish (92%)

---

## üéØ **INVESTIGATION APPROACH: SCIENTIFIC METHOD**

### Phase 1: Evidence Collection (FAST - 10 min)
### Phase 2: Hypothesis Ranking (SMART - 5 min)
### Phase 3: Targeted Testing (EFFICIENT - 15 min)
### Phase 4: Surgical Fix (SAFE - 15 min)
### Phase 5: Dual Verification (THOROUGH - 10 min)

**Total**: 55 minutes (vs 70 min in v1.0)

---

## üìã **PHASE 1: EVIDENCE COLLECTION**

### 1A: Read ALL Error Contexts (Parallel - 5 min)
```bash
# Read error-context.md for all 4 failures
1. P0-07: test-results/.../error-context.md
2. P0-10: test-results/.../error-context.md
3. P0-12: test-results/.../error-context.md
4. P0-13: test-results/.../error-context.md
```

**Extract**:
- Exact error message
- Last successful step
- UI state at failure
- Any API errors in logs

### 1B: Check Historical Baseline (1 min)
```bash
# Terminal history shows successful run
# Lines 75-149: "17 passed (2.3m)"
# Compare which tests were passing then vs now
```

### 1C: Review Our Changes Impact (4 min)
Check each file for Coach Mode dependencies:
- `CompanyIntelligenceCard.tsx` ‚Üí Used in Coach Mode? NO
- `peopleRepository.ts` ‚Üí Used in Coach Mode? NO (People Profiles only)
- `coachRepository.ts` ‚Üí Used in Coach Mode? YES! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `ManagePeopleModal.tsx` ‚Üí Used in Coach Mode? NO
- `app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx` ‚Üí Used in Coach Mode? NO (different page)

**RED FLAG**: `coachRepository.ts` IS used by Coach Mode!

## üîç **PHASE 2: HYPOTHESIS RANKING**

### Rank by Likelihood (High ‚Üí Low)

| # | Hypothesis | Evidence | Likelihood | Test Time |
|---|------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| H1 | **coachRepository.ts change broke something** | We modified people insert logic | üî¥ **HIGH (80%)** | 5 min |
| H2 | **Test execution order pollution** | ui-polish ran first, might leave state | üü° **MEDIUM (60%)** | 10 min |
| H3 | **Pre-existing failures** | Terminal shows mixed historical results | üü° **MEDIUM (50%)** | 5 min |
| H4 | **Mock API responses incorrect** | Mocks might not match new expectations | üü¢ **LOW (30%)** | 10 min |
| H5 | **Timing issues from code changes** | Our changes slow down async operations | üü¢ **LOW (20%)** | 15 min |
| H6 | **Test code has bugs** | Tests themselves might be wrong | üü¢ **VERY LOW (10%)** | 20 min |

**Priority Order**: H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3 ‚Üí H4 ‚Üí H5 ‚Üí H6

## üß™ **PHASE 3: TARGETED TESTING**

### Test H1: coachRepository.ts Impact (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Question**: Did our `updatedAt` fix break people profile creation in Coach Mode?

**Test Strategy**:
```typescript
// What we changed:
await db.insert(peopleProfiles).values({
  ...data,
  updatedAt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000), // ‚Üê NEW
});
```

**Potential Issue**: 
- If `data` already contains `updatedAt` as a different type (milliseconds vs seconds)
- If Coach Mode people analysis expects different schema

**Quick Test**:
1. Read `app/api/jobs/[id]/analyze-people-profiles/route.ts`
2. Check if it uses `upsertPeopleProfile()`
3. Check what data structure it passes
4. Verify our fix is compatible

**If Broken**: 
- Revert coachRepository.ts change
- Make different fix (conditional updatedAt)

---

### Test H2: Test Execution Order (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Question**: Does ui-polish leave dirty state that breaks P0?

**Test Strategy**:
```bash
# Test 1: Run P0 ONLY (fresh state)
rm -rf test-results
npx playwright test coach-mode-critical.spec.ts --workers=1

# Test 2: Run ui-polish THEN P0 (current order)
npx playwright test ui-polish-complete.spec.ts --workers=1
npx playwright test coach-mode-critical.spec.ts --workers=1
```

**Expected**:
- If Test 1 passes (17/20): It's pollution!
- If Test 1 fails (15/20): It's our code changes!

**If Pollution**:
- Add `test.afterAll()` to ui-polish to clean state
- OR run tests in separate processes

---

### Test H3: Historical Baseline (QUICK CHECK)

**Question**: Were these tests already failing?

**Test Strategy**:
```bash
# Check git log for test run commits
git log --oneline --grep="test" -10

# Check for any P0 test result files from before our changes
ls -lt test-results/ | head -20
```

**Expected**: Find timestamp of last successful run

**If Pre-Existing**:
- Document as "inherited tech debt"
- Still fix, but not our regression

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **PHASE 4: SURGICAL FIX STRATEGY**

### Fix Priority Matrix

| Issue | Fix Complexity | Risk | Priority |
|-------|---------------|------|----------|
| coachRepository breaking people analysis | Low (conditional check) | Low | P0 üî¥ |
| Test pollution | Low (add cleanup) | Very Low | P1 üü° |
| Test timing issues | Medium (adjust waits) | Medium | P2 üü¢ |
| Pre-existing failures | High (unknown) | High | P3 üîµ |
