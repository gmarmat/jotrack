At BigTech Corp, I led the migration of our monolithic application to microservices architecture.

Situation: Our monolith was causing 4-hour deployments and preventing us from scaling beyond 10K concurrent users. The business needed to move faster and handle 50K users.

Task: As tech lead, I was responsible for architecting the microservices platform and leading a team of 6 engineers through the migration over 4 months.

Action: I designed the service boundaries using domain-driven design principles, breaking the monolith into 8 microservices. We used Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. The biggest challenge was maintaining zero downtime during migration. I solved this by implementing feature flags for gradual rollout and blue-green deployments. I also conducted weekly architecture reviews and mentored 2 junior engineers on distributed systems patterns.

Result: We reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 30 minutes (87% improvement), cut infrastructure costs by $200K annually through better resource utilization, and successfully scaled to 50K concurrent users. Our team's velocity increased 3x - we shipped features weekly instead of monthly. Two junior engineers on my team were promoted to mid-level roles.
